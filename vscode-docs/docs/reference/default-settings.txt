Default settings reference
==========================

Default settings reference
Visual Studio Code comes with a set of default settings that can be overridden by user or workspace settings. You can change the default settings by using the Settings editor or by editing the settings.json file directly.

To view the list of default settings, run the Preferences: Open Default Settings (JSON) command from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)). This opens a read-only file named defaultSettings.json that contains all the default settings in JSON format.
