Using .NET in Visual Studio Code
================================

Using .NET in Visual Studio Code
.NET provides a fast and modular platform for creating many different types of applications that run on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Use Visual Studio Code with the C# and F# extensions to get a powerful editing experience with C# IntelliSense, F# IntelliSense (smart code completion), and debugging.


Setting up VS Code for .NET development
---------------------------------------
If you are an existing VS Code user, you can add .NET support by installing the C# Dev Kit extension. C# Dev Kit brings a productive and reliable C# experience into VS Code, facilitating C# or multi-language development in VS Code. This extension pack consists of a set of VS Code extensions that work together to provide a rich C# editing experience, AI-powered development, solution management, and integrated testing experiences. As shown in the graphic below, C# Dev Kit consists of:

• The C# extension, which provides the base language services support and continues to be worked on and maintained independent of this effort.
• C# Dev Kit extension, which builds on the same base foundation as Visual Studio and provides solution management, templates, test discovery/debugging.
• The IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit extension(optional), which provides the AI-powered development experience to the editor.


If your projects require F# support, you can also download the .NET Extension Pack, which includes these extensions:

• C# Dev Kit for Visual Studio Code
• Ionide for F#
• Jupyter Notebooks
• Polyglot Notebooks
You can also install extensions separately.


Installing the .NET Software Development Kit
--------------------------------------------
If you download the extensions separately, ensure that you also have the .NET SDK on your local environment. The .NET SDK is a software development environment used for developing .NET applications.

Install the .NET SDK


Create a C# "Hello World" app
-----------------------------
• Initialize a C# project: Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the folder in which you'd like to create the app. Enter the following command in the command shell:   dotnet new console
• When the project folder is first opened in VS Code: A "Required assets to build and debug are missing. Add them?" notification appears at the bottom right of the window. Select Yes.
• Run the app by entering the following command in the command shell: dotnet run

Create an F# "Hello World" app
------------------------------
• Initialize an F# project: Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the folder in which you'd like to create the app. Enter the following command in the command shell: dotnet new console -lang "F#"
• Once it completes, open the project in Visual Studio Code: code .
• Run the app by entering the following command in the command shell:  dotnet run
