Transact-SQL in Visual Studio Code
==================================

Transact-SQL in Visual Studio Code
Turn Visual Studio Code into a powerful editor for Transact-SQL (T-SQL) development, with the mssql extension available in the VS Code Marketplace. The mssql extension is optimized to work with SQL Server running on-premises, in any cloud, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.

Connect to SQL databases, type T-SQL code, execute T-SQL code, view results, and save results as JSON or CSV files. While typing T-SQL code, you get rich T-SQL language features like T-SQL IntelliSense (code completion), syntax highlighting, linting, code navigation and code snippets.

Download VS Code - If you haven't downloaded VS Code yet, quickly install for your platform (Linux, macOS or Windows).


Install T-SQL support
---------------------
Add T-SQL language support to VS Code by installing the mssql extension from the VS Code marketplace as follows:

• Open the Extensions view from VS Code Side Bar (⇧⌘X (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+X)).
• Type "mssql" in the search bar, click Install, and reload VS Code when prompted.



Connect and Execute T-SQL
-------------------------
Easily connect to SQL Server running on-premises, in any cloud, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse. Then, execute your T-SQL statements and batches to view results and messages - all within VS Code. Your recent connections are saved across sessions, so you can quickly connect to your databases again.




View and Save Results
---------------------
View results and messages when you execute your T-SQL code. Save results as a JSON or CSV file to use the data in your applications with just a few clicks.




T-SQL IntelliSense
------------------
As you type T-SQL code in the editor, VS Code provides intelligent code completion for T-SQL keywords, suggestions for schema object names (tables, columns, views), and parameter help for functions and procedures when connected to a database.




Linting
-------
Linting is the analysis of your T-SQL code for potential syntax errors. Use Visual Studio Code to quickly navigate to the errors and warnings in your T-SQL code as you type.




Peek Definition/Go to Definition
--------------------------------
Use Peek Definition or Go to Definition to quickly browse the definition of schema objects in your database such as tables, functions, and procedures while typing T-SQL code.




Snippets
--------
T-SQL snippets provide code templates for commonly used T-SQL statements. Type "sql" to get the list of T-SQL snippets.
