Note
The term "background agent" might also appear as "Copilot CLI" or "worktree" in the VS Code interface while an experiment is being run.

Background agents in Visual Studio Code are CLI-based agents, such as Copilot CLI, that run in the background on your local machine. They operate autonomously while you continue other work in the editor. Background agents use Git worktrees to work isolated from your main workspace and prevent conflicts with your active work.

This article covers the key features of background agents, and how to start and manage background sessions from Copilot CLI.



Tip
Third-party providers like OpenAI Codex also offer background agent capabilities. Learn more about third-party agents.


What are background agents?
---------------------------
Unlike local agents that operate in and have aware of VS Code's editor context, background agents run independently via command-line interfaces (CLIs) on your local machine. You can view and manage all your background agent sessions from the unified Chat view in VS Code. This view also lets you create new background agent sessions directly from VS Code or hand off local agent conversations to background agents.

Because background agents run in the background without user interaction, they are well-suited for tasks that have a well-defined scope and all necessary context. Examples include implementing a feature from a plan, creating multiple variants of a proof of concept, or implementing clearly defined fixes or features.

You can start a new background agent session directly in chat by choosing the background session type. Alternatively, you can hand off a local session to a background agent for continuation in the background.

To prevent interference with your active work in the editor, background agents use Git worktrees to run in an isolated environment where they make changes without affecting your main workspace. When you start a background agent session, VS Code automatically creates a separate folder for that session.


Limitations of background agents
--------------------------------
• Background agents can't directly access VS Code built-in tools and run-time context (like failed tests or text selections), unless you explicitly add that context to the prompt.
• Don't have access to extension-provided tools and are limited to the models available via the CLI tool.
• Can currently only access local MCP servers that don't require authentication.

Copilot CLI
-----------
The Copilot CLI is the primary background agent in VS Code. You can use the Copilot CLI directly from the terminal or start and manage sessions from with VS Code.

VS Code automatically installs and configure the Copilot CLI for you. When you start a session directly in the CLI, that session also appears in the sessions list, where you can track its progress and interact with it further.

Learn more about Copilot CLI in the GitHub documentation.


View and manage background agent sessions
-----------------------------------------
You can view and manage all your background agent sessions from the Chat view in VS Code. Filter the session list to show only background agent sessions by selecting the Background Agents from the filter options.



Select a background agent session from the list to open the session details in the Chat view. If you prefer to view the session in an editor tab (chat editor), right-click the session and select Open as Editor.

If you prefer to view a background session in the terminal instead of the chat conversation in VS Code, right-click the session in the Chat view and select Resume Agent Session in Terminal. You can interact with the Copilot CLI directly in VS Code.




Start a background agent session
--------------------------------
Depending on your workflow, you can start background agent sessions in several ways. You can create a new session and provide the task details directly by using the CLI, or start a new session from the Chat view in VS Code.

Another approach - especially for complex tasks - is to first interact with a local agent in chat in VS Code, and once the scope and details are clear, hand off the task to a background agent session. For example, you might use the Plan agent to outline a multi-step feature implementation, then delegate the actual coding to a background agent.


Create a Copilot CLI background agent session
---------------------------------------------
You can create a new Copilot CLI background agent session in VS Code in several ways:

• From the Chat view: Open the Chat view (⌃⌘I (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Alt+I)) Select the Delegate Session dropdown > Background
• While you're in a local chat session: Enter a prompt, select the Delegate Session dropdown > Background
• Run the Chat: New Background Agent command from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P))
A new background agent session opens where you can provide additional task details and track the progress of the Copilot CLI session.

You can attach images in the chat input to provide visual context for a background session.

Tip
When you use the GitHub Copilot CLI in the terminal to start a session, the Chat view in VS Code automatically detects and displays this background session. You can further interact with this background session from within VS Code.


Hand off an agent session to a background agent
-----------------------------------------------
For complex tasks, it can be helpful to first interact with a local agent in VS Code chat to clarify requirements, then hand off the task to a background agent for autonomous execution. When you hand off a local agent conversation to a background agent session, the full conversation history and context is passed to the background agent.

To continue a local agent session in a background agent session:

• Open the Chat view (⌃⌘I (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Alt+I))
• Interact with a local agent until you're ready to hand off the task to a background agent
• To hand off to a background agent, you have the following options: Open the Delegate Session dropdown and then select Background If you're using the Plan agent, select the Start Implementation dropdown and the select Continue in Background to run the implementation in a background agent session
The background agent session starts automatically, carrying over the full conversation history and context. You can monitor the background agent's progress in the Chat view.


Create background agent session
-------------------------------
Background agent sessions automatically use Git worktrees to isolate changes from your main workspace. When you start a background agent session, VS Code creates a separate folder for the session. The background agent operates in this isolated folder, to prevent conflicts with your active work.

To start a background agent session with Git worktrees:

• In the Chat view, select the Delegate Session dropdown and then select Background from the session type dropdown.
• Enter a prompt to start the agent session. VS Code automatically creates a new Git worktree. All changes made by the background agent are applied to the worktree folder, isolating them from your main workspace. Background agents commit changes to the worktree at the end of each turn, so the session history stays aligned with the commit history. Tip You can open the worktree for a background agent session by right-clicking it in the session list and selecting Open Worktree in New Window. You can also view the worktree in the Source Control view repository explorer (scm.repositories.explorer).
• Monitor the background agent's progress in the Chat view. The agent sessions list displays diff statistics that match the changes in the worktree.
• After the background agent completes the task, review and apply the changes from the worktree to your main workspace. The working set at the bottom of the session shows the files changed during the background agent session and provides Apply and View All Changes actions.
• When you apply changes, VS Code handles any conflicts with your working tree or staged files. If conflicts occur, a merge resolution experience helps you resolve them.

Multi-repository workspaces
---------------------------
When your workspace contains multiple Git repositories, VS Code displays a repository picker in the chat input when you start a background agent session. Use this picker to select which repository the worktree should be created in.

After the session starts, the repository picker becomes disabled for that session. The worktree appears under the selected repository in the Worktrees node in the Source Control Repositories view.

Tip
To view all repositories in your workspace, enable the

scm.repositories.explorer
• Open in VS Code
• Open in VS Code Insiders
setting and open the Source Control view.



Use custom agents with background agents (Experimental)
-------------------------------------------------------
Custom agents let you define custom personas and roles for agents in VS Code. For example, you might create a custom agent for performing code reviews. Custom agents can define specific instructions and behaviors.

When you create a background agent session, you can select a custom agent to handle the task. The background agent operates according to the custom agent's defined behavior.

To enable custom agents with background agents:

• Enable custom agents for background agents with the github.copilot.chat.cli.customAgents.enabled Open in VS Code Open in VS Code Insiders setting
• Create a custom agent in your workspace with the Chat: New Custom Agent command from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)) Note Currently, only custom agents defined in the workspace are available for background agent sessions. Learn more about creating a custom agent.
• Create a new background agent session and select the custom agent from the Agents dropdown
• Enter a prompt and notice that the custom agent is used to handle the task
