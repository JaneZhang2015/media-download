Chat participant
Description

Use the
[代码]
@github
[/代码]
participant to ask questions about GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and more. Get more information about the
available GitHub skills (https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-your-ide#currently-available-skills).

Example:
[代码]
@github What are all of the open PRs assigned to me?

Use the
[代码]
@vscode

@workspace
[/代码]
Use the
[代码]
@workspace
[/代码]
participant to ask questions about the current workspace.

Example:
[代码]
@workspace how is authentication implemented?
[/代码]

Use agents
----------
When using agents, you can use natural language to specify a high-level task, and let AI autonomously reason about the request, plan the work needed, and apply the changes to your codebase. Agents use a combination of code editing and tool invocation to accomplish the task you specified. As it processes your request, it monitors the outcome of edits and tools, and iterates to resolve any issues that arise.

Action
Description
⇧⌘I
(Windows
Ctrl+Shift+I
, Linux
Ctrl+Shift+Alt+I
)
Switch to using agents in the Chat view
Tools (
)
Configure which tools are available when using agents. Select from built-in tools, MCP servers, and extension-provided tools.
Auto-approve tools
Enable
auto-approval of all tools (/docs/copilot/agents/agent-tools#_auto-approve-all-tools)when using agents (
chat.tools.autoApprove
• Open in VS Code
• Open in VS Code Insiders
).
Auto-approve terminal commands
Enable
auto-approval of terminal commands (/docs/copilot/agents/agent-tools#_automatically-approve-terminal-commands)when using agents (
chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove
• Open in VS Code
• Open in VS Code Insiders
).
MCP
Configure
MCP servers (/docs/copilot/customization/mcp-servers)to extend agent capabilities and tools.
Third-party agents (/docs/copilot/agents/third-party-agents)Use agents from external providers like Claude Agent (Preview) and OpenAI Codex with your Copilot subscription.
Claude Agent
(Preview)
Start a Claude Agent session powered by Anthropic's Claude Agent SDK. Use
[代码]
/agents
[/代码]
,
[代码]
/hooks
[/代码]
, and
[代码]
/memory
[/代码]
slash commands for advanced workflows.
Tips

• Add extra tools when using agents to extend its capabilities.
• Configure custom agents to define how the agent should operate, for example to implement a read-only planning mode.
• Define custom instructions to guide agents on how to generate and structure code.
• Try third-party agents like Claude Code or OpenAI Codex for alternative agentic coding experiences.

Planning
--------
Use the plan agent in VS Code chat to create detailed implementation plans before starting complex coding tasks. Hand off the approved plan to an implementation agent to start coding.

Action
Description
Plan agent
Select the
Plan
agent from the agents dropdown or use the
[代码]
/plan
[/代码]
slash command to create a detailed implementation plan for complex coding tasks.
Todo list
View a todo list to track progress on complex tasks. Enable this with the
[代码]
setting(chat.tools.todos.showWidget
[/代码]
setting.

Customize your chat experience
------------------------------
Customize your chat experience to generate responses that match your coding style, tools, and developer workflow. There are several ways to customize your chat experience in VS Code:

• Custom instructions: Define common guidelines or rules for tasks like generating code, performing code reviews, or generating commit messages. Custom instructions describe the conditions in which the AI should operate (how a task should be done).
• Reusable prompt files: Define reusable prompts for common tasks like generating code or performing a code review. Prompt files are standalone prompts that you can run directly in chat. They describe the task to be performed (what should be done).
• Custom agents: Define how chat operates, which tools it can use, and how it interacts with the codebase. Each chat prompt is run within the boundaries of the agent, without having to configure tools and instructions for every request.
Tips

• Define language-specific instructions to get more accurate generated code for each language.
• Store your instructions in your workspace to easily share them with your team.
• Define reusable prompt files for common tasks to save time and help team members get started quickly.

Editor AI features
------------------
As you're coding in the editor, you can use Copilot to generate inline suggestions as you're typing. Invoke Inline Chat to ask questions and get help from Copilot, while staying in the flow of coding. For example, ask Copilot to generate unit tests for a function or method. Get more information about inline suggestions and Inline Chat.

Action
Description
Inline suggestions
Start typing in the editor and get
inline suggestions (/docs/copilot/ai-powered-suggestions)that match your coding style and take your existing code into account.
Code comments
Provide an inline suggestions prompt by writing instructions in a code comment.

Example:
[代码]
# write a calculator class with methods for add, subtract, and multiply. Use static methods.
[/代码]
⌘I
(Windows, Linux
Ctrl+I
)
Start editor inline chat to send a chat request directly from the editor. Use natural language and reference chat variables and slash commands to provide context.
F2
Get AI-powered suggestions when renaming symbols in your code.
Context menu actions
Use the editor context menu to access common AI actions, such as explaining code, generating tests, reviewing code, and more. Right-click in the editor to open the context menu and select
Generate Code
.
Code Actions (lightbulb)
Select the Code Action (lightbulb) in the editor for fixing linting or compiler errors in your code.
Tips

• Use meaningful method or function names to get better inline suggestions quicker.
