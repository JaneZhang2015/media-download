When you interact with chat in Visual Studio Code, the AI can generate code edits across multiple files in your project. This article explains how to review, accept, or discard these AI-generated code edits.


Pending changes
---------------
Once the AI has made changes to your files, they are directly applied and saved to disk. VS Code keeps track of which files have pending edits and lets you review them individually or all at once.

The Chat view shows the list of files that were edited and are pending your review. Files with pending edits also have an indicator in the Explorer view and editor tabs with a squared-dot icon.



When you open a file that was changed, the editor shows an inline diff of the applied changes.

When you close VS Code, the status of the pending edits is remembered and restored when you reopen VS Code.


Review changes
--------------
Follow these steps to review the AI-generated code edits in a file:

• Open a file with pending edits by selecting it from the changed files list in the Chat view or from the Explorer view.
• Use the Up and Down controls in the editor overlay to navigate between individual edits within the file.
• For each edit, choose one of the following actions: Select Keep to accept the edit. Select Undo to reject the edit and revert the change. Hover over an inline change to accept or reject that specific change without affecting other edits in the file.
• Alternatively, accept or reject all changes across all files at once from the Chat view.


The following keyboard shortcuts help you navigate and review edits:

Source Control integration
--------------------------
If you stage your changes in the Source Control view, any pending edits are automatically accepted. On the other hand, if you discard your changes, any pending edits are also discarded.


Auto-accept edits
-----------------
You can configure VS Code to automatically accept AI-generated code edits after a configurable delay with the

chat.editing.autoAccept
• Open in VS Code
• Open in VS Code Insiders
setting. Hover over the editor overlay controls to stop the auto-accept countdown.


Important
If you automatically accept all edits, it's strongly recommended to review the changes before committing them in source control. Learn more about the security considerations of using AI in VS Code.


Edit sensitive files
--------------------
To prevent inadvertent edits to sensitive files, such as workspace configuration settings or environment settings, VS Code prompts you to approve edits before they are applied. In chat, you can see a diff view of the proposed changes and choose to approve or reject them.

Use the

chat.tools.edits.autoApprove
• Open in VS Code
• Open in VS Code Insiders
setting to configure which files require approval. The setting uses glob patterns to match file paths in your workspace.


The following example configuration automatically allows edits to all files except for JSON files in the .vscode folder and files named .env, which you are prompted to approve:

[代码]
"chat.tools.edits.autoApprove": {
  "**/*": true,
  "**/.vscode/*.json": false,
  "**/.env": false
}
[/代码]
