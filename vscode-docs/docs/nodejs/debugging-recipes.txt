JavaScript Debugging Recipes

JavaScript Debugging Recipes
Visual Studio Code supports debugging of many languages and platforms via debuggers that are either built-in or contributed by extensions.

To make it easier to get started with debugging, we have made a collection of debugging "recipes" which contain the steps and configuration you need to set up debugging for your favorite platform. The recipes are in GitHub at https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-recipes.
