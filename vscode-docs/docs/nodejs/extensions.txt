Recommended extensions
----------------------
If you are just getting started, here are the extensions we recommend trying out.


ESLint
------
Marketplace - ESLint

Publisher - Microsoft

Easily integrate ESLint into your project. If ESLint isn't your favorite linter, choose among a variety of other linter extensions, including JSHint, JSCS, and JS Standard.

Read more about setting up JavaScript linters in the VS Code documentation.




SonarLint
---------
Marketplace - SonarLint

Publisher - SonarSource

SonarLint helps you find and fix bugs and security issues as you code. The extension runs in the background and, just like a spell checker, highlights coding issues. SonarLint not only tells you what the issue is but also provides in-context guidance on why an issue is harmful and how to fix it, with related examples. The extension supports 200+ JS/TS rules and includes several Quick Fixes to automatically handle your coding issues.

Search for 'SonarLint' in the VS Code Marketplace and install. No configuration is required. You can start with a default profile that fits most users and customize it based on your specific needs.
