Customize the Container Tools extension
=======================================

Customize the Container Tools extension
The Container Tools extension includes several Visual Studio Code tasks to control the behavior of Docker build and run, and form the basis of container startup for debugging.

The tasks allow for a great deal of control and customization. The final configuration is a combination of general defaults, platform-specific defaults (such as Node.js, Python, or .NET), and user input. User input takes precedence when it conflicts with defaults.

All common features of Visual Studio Code tasks (for example, grouping tasks into compound tasks) are supported by Container Tools extension tasks. For more information on common task features and properties, see the Visual Studio Code custom task documentation.


Docker build task
-----------------
The docker-build task builds images using the Docker command line (CLI). The task can be used by itself, or as part of a chain of tasks to run and/or debug an application within a container.

The most important configuration settings for the docker-build task are dockerBuild and platform:

• The dockerBuild object specifies parameters for the Docker build command. Values specified by this object are applied directly to Docker build CLI invocation.
• The platform property is a hint that changes how the docker-build task determines Docker build defaults.
See property reference for full list of all task properties.


Platform support
----------------
While the docker-build task in tasks.json can be used to build any image, the extension has explicit support (and simplified configuration) for Node.js, Python, and .NET Core.


Node.js (docker-build)
----------------------
Minimal configuration using defaults

A Node.js-based image with no specific platform options can just set the platform property to node:

[代码]
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Build Node Image",
      "type": "docker-build",
      "platform": "node"
    }
  ]
}
[/代码]
Platform defaults

For Node.js-based images, the docker-build task infers the following options:

Property
Inferred Value
[代码]
dockerBuild.context
[/代码]
The same directory in which the
[代码]
package.json
[/代码]
resides.

[代码]
name
[/代码]
property in
[代码]
package.json
[/代码]
(if defined), else the base name of the folder in which
[代码]
package.json
[/代码]
resides.
[代码]
dockerBuild.pull
[/代码]
Defaults to true in order to pull new base images before building.

Python (docker-build)
---------------------
Minimal configuration using defaults

A Python-based image with no specific platform options can just set the platform property to python:

[代码]
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "docker-build",
      "label": "docker-build",
      "platform": "python"
    }
  ]
}
[/代码]

[/代码]
Defaults to true in order to pull new base images before building.

.NET (docker-build)
-------------------

  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {

      }
    }
  ]
}
[/代码]

Command customization
---------------------
The Container Tools extension executes a number of Docker CLI commands when you perform various operations, such as to build images, run containers, attach to containers, and view container logs. Some of these commands have a large number of optional arguments, often used in very specific scenarios. As an alternative to the above Visual Studio Code tasks, several commands can be customized when tasks are not in use.

For example, the tokens ${serviceList} and ${profileList} in the Compose Up command allows for easily starting a subset of the services within your Docker Compose YAML file(s).

For each of these customizable Docker commands, a configuration setting is available to set the template of what to execute. Alternatively, you can define multiple templates, optionally with a regular expression, which when matched, hints the context in which a template should be used. The templates support some tokens similar to launch.json and tasks.json, for example, ${workspaceFolder}.


Settings JSON schema
--------------------
You have two options for configuring each of the templates (listed below). The first option is a single template that overrides the default behavior:

[代码]
{
  "containers.commands.build": "docker build --rm -f \"${dockerfile}\" -t ${tag} \"${context}\""
}
[/代码]
The second option is multiple templates that will be chosen based on the match regular expression, as well as user input.

For example, three templates are shown in the following example:

Selection behavior
------------------
The command template chosen to execute is selected based on the following rules:

• If no setting is configured, the default command template is chosen.
• If only a single template is configured (the first example above), that template is chosen.
• If multiple templates are configured: Constrained templates are checked. A constrained template has match. The match regular expression is compared against contextual hints--for example, image name, container name, etc. If multiple constrained templates apply, the user will be prompted to choose. If only one applies, the user will not be prompted. If there no applicable constrained templates, unconstrained templates are checked. An unconstrained template does not have match, and is therefore always applicable. If multiple unconstrained templates apply, the user will be prompted to choose. If only one applies, the user will not be prompted.

Docker Build
------------
Configuration Setting
Default Value
[代码]
docker.commands.build
[/代码]
[代码]
${containerCommand} build --rm -f "${dockerfile}" -t ${tag} "${context}"
[/代码]
Supported tokens:

Token
Description
[代码]
${containerCommand}
[/代码]
The CLI command / executable used to execute container commands.
[代码]
${dockerfile}
[/代码]
The workspace-relative path of the selected
[代码]
Dockerfile
[/代码]
.
[代码]
${tag}
[/代码]
The value entered/confirmed by the user upon invoking the build command. If previously built, defaults to the previously entered value for that
[代码]
Dockerfile
[/代码]
.
[代码]
${context}
[/代码]
If set, the value of the
[代码]
containers.imageBuildContextPath
[/代码]
configuration setting. Otherwise, the workspace-relative folder in which the
[代码]
Dockerfile
[/代码]
resides.
Note: If the containers.commands.build setting does not contain the ${tag} token, the user will not be prompted to enter/confirm a tag.

Note: The match regular expression will be compared against the selected Dockerfile name and the workspace folder name.


Docker Run
----------
Configuration Setting
Default Value
[代码]
containers.commands.run
[/代码]
[代码]
${containerCommand} run --rm -d ${exposedPorts} ${tag}

[/代码]
Supported tokens:

Token
Description
[代码]
${containerCommand}
[/代码]
The CLI command / executable used to execute container commands.
[代码]
${exposedPorts}
[/代码]
Generated from the list of exposed ports in the image (ultimately from the
[代码]
Dockerfile
[/代码]
), where each exposed port is mapped to the same port on the local machine. For example,
[代码]
"EXPOSE 5000 5001"
[/代码]
would generate
[代码]
"-p 5000:5000 -p 5001:5001"
[/代码]
.
[代码]
${tag}
[/代码]
The full tag of the selected image.
Note: The match regular expression will be compared against the full tag of the selected image.

[/代码]
The ID of the container to attach to.
[代码]
${shellCommand}
[/代码]
If
[代码]
bash
[/代码]
is present in the container, it is substituted here, otherwise
[代码]
sh
[/代码]
. In Windows containers,
[代码]
cmd
[/代码]
is always used.
Note: The match regular expression will be compared against the container name and full tag of the container image.

-f
[/代码]
plus the workspace-relative path to the selected Docker Compose YAML file.
[代码]
${detached}
