Centrally manage VS Code settings with policies
===============================================

Centrally manage VS Code settings with policies
Enterprise policies in Visual Studio Code enable organizations to centrally manage VS Code settings for their development teams to ensure consistency and compatibility across their organization. When a policy value is set, the value overrides the VS Code setting value configured at any level (default, user, and workspace).

IT admins can deploy and enforce specific VS Code configurations on users' devices through different device management solutions. VS Code supports applying policies on Windows, macOS, and Linux.



In this article, you learn which enterprise policies are available in VS Code and how to configure them on different operating systems.


Windows group policies
----------------------
VS Code has support for Windows Registry-based Group Policy.

These profiles can be deployed using Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions or installed manually on individual devices.


Step 1: Obtain the sample ADMX and ADML files
---------------------------------------------
Starting from VS Code version 1.69, each release ships with a policies directory containing ADMX template files that define the available policies.

You can get the ADMX and ADML files from either an existing installation or by downloading and extracting the VS Code zip archive. Follow these steps to obtain the files:

• Download the VS Code zip archive for your version of VS Code.
• Extract the zip file to a temporary location.
• Navigate to the policies folder in the extracted files. This folder contains the ADMX template files (for example, vscode.admx) and a locales subfolder with ADML files for different languages.

Step 2: Configure policy values
-------------------------------
Edit the policy values according to your requirements:

String policies - policies that accept text values or JSON strings:

[代码]
<!-- Example: Allow extensions from specific publishers -->
<key>AllowedExtensions</key>
<string>{"microsoft": true, "github": true}</string>

<!-- Example: Set update mode to a specific value -->
<key>UpdateMode</key>
<string>start</string>
[/代码]
Important
If there's a syntax error in the policy value, the setting will not be applied. You can check the Window log in VS Code for errors (press ⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P) and enter Show Window Log).

Boolean policies - policies that accept true/false values:

[代码]
<!-- Example: Enable user feedback -->
<key>EnableFeedback</key>
<true/>

<!-- Example: Disable telemetry -->
<key>EnableTelemetry</key>
<false/>
[/代码]
Remove unwanted policies - delete both the key and value for any policy you don't want to enforce:

[代码]
<!-- To not enforce an update mode policy, remove these lines: -->
<key>UpdateMode</key>
<string>start</string>
[/代码]
Refer to the policy reference below for details on each policy's accepted values and behavior.


Step 3: Deploy the policies
---------------------------
You can now deploy the configured policies at scale to all relevant devices in your organization using a device management solution. You can manually test the policies on a local Windows machine before deploying them at scale using the Local Group Policy Editor.

Deploy policies at scale
Products such as Microsoft Intune or Active Directory Group Policy can be used to centrally manage device policy at scale across an organization. These solutions allow administrators to deploy the ADMX/ADML files and policy configurations to multiple devices from a central location.

For Active Directory environments, copy the ADMX and ADML files to the Central Store to make the policies available across the domain.

Manually test policies on a local machine
If you want to test the policies on a local Windows machine before deploying them at scale, you can manually install the ADMX/ADML files and configure the policies using the Local Group Policy Editor.

Follow these steps to configure VS Code policies on a local Windows machine:


Step 1: Install the policy definition files
-------------------------------------------
• Copy the vscode.admx file to C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions.
• Copy the appropriate ADML file from the locales subfolder (for example, en-US\vscode.adml) to C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions\<your-locale> (for example, C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions\en-US).
Note
You need administrator privileges to copy files to the PolicyDefinitions directory.


Step 2: Open the Local Group Policy Editor
------------------------------------------
• Press Windows+R to open the Run dialog.
• Type gpedit.msc and press Enter to open the Local Group Policy Editor.
• If prompted by User Account Control, select Yes to allow the app to make changes.

Step 3: Navigate to VS Code policies
------------------------------------
The VS Code policies are available under both Computer Configuration and User Configuration:

• Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Microsoft VS Code
• User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Microsoft VS Code
Tip
Computer-level policies take precedence over user-level policies when both are configured.


Step 4: Configure a policy
--------------------------
• Select the policy category (either Computer Configuration or User Configuration).
• Navigate to Administrative Templates > Microsoft VS Code.
• Double-click on the policy you want to configure (for example, Update Mode).
• In the policy settings dialog, select Enabled to enforce the policy.
• Configure the policy value using the available options or text fields.
• Select OK to save the changes.
• Close the Local Group Policy Editor.
The policy will take effect the next time VS Code is started. Some policies may require restarting Windows to take effect.


macOS configuration profiles
----------------------------
Configuration profiles manage settings on macOS devices. A profile is an XML file (.mobileconfig) with key/value pairs that correspond to available policies.

These profiles can be deployed using Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions or installed manually on individual devices.


Step 1: Obtain the sample configuration profile
-----------------------------------------------
Starting from VS Code version 1.99, each release ships with a sample .mobileconfig file. Follow these steps to locate the sample file on a macOS device with VS Code installed:

• Open Finder and navigate to /Applications.
• Right-click on Visual Studio Code.app (or your VS Code variant) and select Show Package Contents.
• Navigate to Contents/Resources/app/policies.
• Locate the sample .mobileconfig file (for example, vscode-sample.mobileconfig).

Step 2: Configure policy values
-------------------------------
• Copy the sample .mobileconfig file to a working location (for example, your Desktop or Documents folder).
• Open the copied file in a text editor (for example, TextEdit, VS Code, or any XML editor).
• Edit the policy values according to your requirements: String policies - policies that accept text values or JSON strings: <!-- Example: Allow extensions from specific publishers -->
<key>AllowedExtensions</key>
<string>{"microsoft": true, "github": true}</string>

<!-- Example: Set update mode to a specific value -->
<key>UpdateMode</key>
<string>start</string>
 Important If there's a syntax error in the policy value, the setting will not be applied. You can check the Window log in VS Code for errors (press ⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P) and enter Show Window Log). Boolean policies - policies that accept true/false values: <!-- Example: Enable user feedback -->
<key>EnableFeedback</key>
<true/>

<!-- Example: Disable telemetry -->
<key>EnableTelemetry</key>
<false/>
 Remove unwanted policies - delete both the key and value for any policy you don't want to enforce: <!-- To not enforce an update mode policy, remove these lines: -->
<key>UpdateMode</key>
<string>start</string>
Refer to the policy reference for details on each policy's accepted values and behavior.


Step 3: Deploy the policies
---------------------------
You can now deploy the configured policies at scale to all relevant devices in your organization with an MDM solution. You can manually test the policies on a local machine before deploying them at scale.

Deploy profiles at scale
For enterprise deployments across multiple devices, use Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions such as:

• Microsoft Intune
• Apple Business Manager with MDM
For more information on configuration profiles, refer to Apple's documentation.

Manually test policies on a local machine

Configure policies manually
---------------------------
Follow these steps to manually test your VS Code policy configuration on a macOS device before deploying at scale:


Step 1: Install the configuration profile
-----------------------------------------
• Save your edited .mobileconfig file.
• Double-click the .mobileconfig file in Finder.
• The System Settings (or System Preferences on older macOS versions) will open.
• Review the profile details and select Install (or Continue depending on your macOS version).
• If prompted, authenticate with your administrator credentials.
• Confirm the installation when prompted.

Step 2: Verify the profile installation
---------------------------------------
• Open System Settings (macOS Ventura and later) or System Preferences (earlier versions).
• Navigate to Privacy & Security > Profiles (or General > Device Management on older versions).
• Verify that your VS Code configuration profile appears in the list.
• Launch VS Code to see the policies in effect.
Note
Policies take effect immediately for new VS Code instances. You may need to restart VS Code if it's already running.


Remove a configuration profile
------------------------------
To remove policies and revert to default settings:

• Open System Settings > Privacy & Security > Profiles.
• Select the VS Code configuration profile.
• Select the Remove (or -) button.
• Authenticate with your administrator credentials to confirm removal.

Linux JSON policies
-------------------
Starting from VS Code version 1.106, you can configure VS Code setting policies on Linux devices by placing a JSON policy file at /etc/vscode/policy.json. This approach uses a simple JSON format to define policy values.

These profiles can be deployed using Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions or installed manually on individual devices.


Step 1: Obtain the sample policy file
-------------------------------------
Starting from VS Code version 1.106, each release ships with a sample .policy.json file. You can obtain it from either an existing installation or by downloading and extracting the VS Code archive. The file is located in the resources/app/policies directory.


Step 2: Configure policy values
-------------------------------
• Copy the sample policy.json file to a working location: sudo cp /usr/share/code/resources/app/policies/policy.json /tmp/policy.json
• Edit the file using your preferred text editor: sudo nano /tmp/policy.json
# or
sudo vim /tmp/policy.json
# or
code /tmp/policy.json
• Edit the policy values according to your requirements: String policies - policies that accept text values or JSON strings: <!-- Example: Allow extensions from specific publishers -->
<key>AllowedExtensions</key>
<string>{"microsoft": true, "github": true}</string>

<!-- Example: Set update mode to a specific value -->
<key>UpdateMode</key>
<string>start</string>
 Important If there's a syntax error in the policy value, the setting will not be applied. You can check the Window log in VS Code for errors (press ⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P) and enter Show Window Log). Boolean policies - policies that accept true/false values: <!-- Example: Enable user feedback -->
<key>EnableFeedback</key>
<true/>

<!-- Example: Disable telemetry -->
<key>EnableTelemetry</key>
<false/>
 Remove unwanted policies - delete both the key and value for any policy you don't want to enforce: <!-- To not enforce an update mode policy, remove these lines: -->
<key>UpdateMode</key>
<string>start</string>
Refer to the policy reference for details on each policy's accepted values and behavior.


Step 3: Deploy the policies
---------------------------
You can now deploy the configured policies at scale to all relevant devices in your organization with an MDM solution. You can manually test the policies on a local machine before deploying them at scale.

Deploy policies at scale
For enterprise Linux deployments across multiple devices, use configuration management tools such as Ansible, Puppet, Chef, or Salt to deploy the policy.json file.

These tools allow administrators to deploy, update, and remove policies remotely across all managed Linux devices in the organization.

Manually test policies on a local machine

Step 1: Copy the policy file
----------------------------
• Ensure the /etc/vscode directory exists: sudo mkdir -p /etc/vscode
 Note You need root or sudo privileges to create the directory and manage policy files in /etc/vscode.
• Copy the edited policy file to the /etc/vscode/ system location: sudo cp /tmp/policy.json /etc/vscode/policy.json
 Set appropriate permissions: sudo chmod 644 /etc/vscode/policy.json
sudo chown root:root /etc/vscode/policy.json

Step 2: Verify the policy installation
--------------------------------------
• Launch VS Code (or restart it if already running).
• Open File > Preferences > Settings (or press Ctrl+,).
• Look for settings that correspond to your configured policies - they should show as "managed by your organization" or have a lock icon.
• Hover over managed settings to see that they are controlled by policy.
Tip
You can verify the policy file is being read by checking VS Code's logs or by attempting to change a managed setting (the change will be prevented).


Remove policies
---------------
To remove all policies and revert to default settings, delete the /etc/vscode/policy.json file and restart VS Code.
