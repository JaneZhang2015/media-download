VS Code for enterprise
======================

VS Code for enterprise
Visual Studio Code can be used as a development tool for enterprise teams of all sizes. As an IT admin, you can configure VS Code to achieve consistency and compliance across your organization.


Enterprise policies
-------------------
VS Code supports centrally managed policies that override user settings on managed devices. Policies can be deployed through device management solutions like Microsoft Intune, Active Directory Group Policy, or MDM solutions on macOS.

Policies are available to control:

• AI and Copilot features - Agent mode, MCP servers, and tool approvals
• Extensions - Allowed extensions and private marketplace
• Telemetry - Data collection levels and feedback mechanisms
• Automatic updates - Control when and how VS Code updates
See the enterprise policies reference for a complete list of available policies.


Extension management
--------------------
Organizations can control which extensions are installed on users' machines and host a private extension marketplace.

• Allowed extensions - Specify which extensions can be installed by publisher, extension ID, or version
• Private marketplace - Self-host extensions for your organization and control access to the public marketplace
Learn more about managing extensions in enterprise environments.


Network configuration
---------------------
VS Code requires network access for several features, including automatic updates, extension marketplace, and telemetry. For environments with restricted network access or proxy servers, you might need to configure:

• Firewall allowlist - Allow specific hostnames for VS Code functionality
• Proxy server - VS Code uses system proxy settings by default
• SSL certificates - Configure trusted certificates for HTTPS proxies
For detailed network configuration, see Network connections in VS Code.


Common hostnames
----------------
If your firewall requires an allowlist, the key hostnames to allow include:

• update.code.visualstudio.com - Updates
• marketplace.visualstudio.com - Extension marketplace
• *.gallery.vsassets.io - Extension assets
• vscode.download.prss.microsoft.com - Downloads
See the complete list of hostnames in the network documentation.


Preinstalled extensions
-----------------------
You can prepare machine images or virtual machines with VS Code and a set of preinstalled extensions. When users launch VS Code for the first time, the extensions are installed automatically.
