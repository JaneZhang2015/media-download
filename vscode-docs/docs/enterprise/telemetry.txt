Manage telemetry in enterprise environments
===========================================

Manage telemetry in enterprise environments
VS Code collects telemetry data to help understand how the product is used and to improve it. Organizations can centrally manage telemetry settings to control what data is collected across their development teams.

This article covers how IT admins can configure telemetry through enterprise policies.


Telemetry-related policies
--------------------------
VS Code provides the following policies for managing telemetry:

Policy
Description
VS Code setting
Available since
[代码]
TelemetryLevel
[/代码]
Specify the telemetry data level
telemetry.telemetryLevel
• Open in VS Code
• Open in VS Code Insiders
ORG
1.99
[代码]
EnableFeedback
[/代码]
Configure feedback mechanisms (issue reporter and surveys)
telemetry.feedback.enabled
• Open in VS Code
• Open in VS Code Insiders
ORG
1.99
Learn how to deploy policies to your organization's devices.


Configure telemetry level
-------------------------
The TelemetryLevel policy controls VS Code telemetry, first-party extension telemetry, and participating third-party extension telemetry.

Note
Some third-party extensions might not respect this setting. Consult the specific extension's documentation to learn about its telemetry reporting.


Telemetry level options
-----------------------
Value
Crash reports
Error telemetry
Usage data
[代码]
all
[/代码]
✓
✓
✓
[代码]
error
[/代码]
✓
✓
-
[代码]
crash
[/代码]
✓

[代码]
off
[/代码]

Data types:

• Crash reports - Diagnostic information when VS Code crashes
• Error telemetry - Information about errors that don't crash the application
• Usage data - Information about feature usage and performance

Disable telemetry
-----------------
To disable all telemetry across your organization, set the TelemetryLevel policy to off:

Policy value:

[代码]
off
[/代码]
Important
Setting telemetry to off or error disables A/B experimentation. This might delay the rollout of new features to your users until they are generally available.


Enable error telemetry only
---------------------------
To collect only crash reports and error telemetry while disabling usage data, set the TelemetryLevel policy to error:

Policy value:

[代码]
error
[/代码]

Configure feedback mechanisms
-----------------------------
The EnableFeedback policy controls whether users can access feedback mechanisms in VS Code, such as the issue reporter and surveys.

To disable feedback mechanisms, set the EnableFeedback policy to false:

Policy value:

[代码]
false
[/代码]

Extension telemetry
-------------------
VS Code extensions might collect their own telemetry data. The

telemetry.telemetryLevel
• Open in VS Code
• Open in VS Code Insiders
ORG
setting affects first-party Microsoft extensions and participating third-party extensions. However, some extensions might not respect this setting and might have their own telemetry configuration.


Review the documentation of extensions used in your organization to understand their telemetry practices.


GDPR compliance
---------------
VS Code is designed to be GDPR compliant. When users disable telemetry, VS Code stops sending telemetry data going forward. For more information about GDPR and VS Code, see the telemetry documentation.
