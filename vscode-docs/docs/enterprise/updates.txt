Manage updates in enterprise environments
=========================================

Manage updates in enterprise environments
VS Code releases monthly updates with new features, bug fixes, and security patches. Organizations can centrally manage how VS Code updates are handled across their development teams.

This article covers how IT admins can configure automatic updates through enterprise policies.


Update policy
-------------
VS Code provides the UpdateMode policy for controlling automatic updates. This policy controls the

update.mode
• Open in VS Code
• Open in VS Code Insiders
ORG
setting in VS Code.


Learn how to deploy policies to your organization's devices.


Update mode options
-------------------
The UpdateMode policy accepts the following values:

Value
Description
[代码]
default
[/代码]
Automatic checking for updates is enabled and runs in the background
[代码]
start
[/代码]
Check for updates only when VS Code starts
[代码]
manual
[/代码]
Automatic checking is disabled; users can manually check for updates
[代码]
none
[/代码]
Updates are disabled entirely

Disable automatic updates
-------------------------
To prevent VS Code from automatically checking for or installing updates, set the UpdateMode policy to none:

Policy value:

[代码]
none
[/代码]
When updates are disabled, users cannot update VS Code through the application. You can then control VS Code versions through your software deployment tools.


Enable manual updates only
--------------------------
To allow users to check for updates manually while disabling automatic background checks, set the UpdateMode policy to manual:

Policy value:

[代码]
manual
[/代码]
Users can check for updates by selecting Help > Check for Updates.


Check for updates at startup only
---------------------------------
To check for updates only when VS Code starts, without background checking, set the UpdateMode policy to start:

Policy value:

[代码]
start
[/代码]

Network requirements
--------------------
VS Code downloads updates from Microsoft servers. If your network has restricted access, ensure the following hostname is allowed:

• update.code.visualstudio.com - VS Code download and update server
See the network documentation for a complete list of hostnames.
