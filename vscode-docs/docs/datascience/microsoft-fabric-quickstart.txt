Data science in Microsoft Fabric using Visual Studio Code
=========================================================

Data science in Microsoft Fabric using Visual Studio Code
You can build and develop data science and data engineering solutions for Microsoft Fabric within VS Code. Microsoft Fabric extensions for VS Code provide an integrated development experience for working with Fabric artifacts, lakehouses, notebooks, and user data functions.


What is Microsoft Fabric?
-------------------------
Microsoft Fabric is an enterprise-ready, end-to-end analytics platform. It unifies data movement, data processing, ingestion, transformation, real-time event routing, and report building. It supports these capabilities with integrated services like Data Engineering, Data Factory, Data Science, Real-Time Intelligence, Data Warehouse, and Databases. Sign up for free and explore Microsoft Fabric for 60 days — no credit card required.




Prerequisites
-------------
Before you get started with Microsoft Fabric extensions for VS Code, you need:

• Visual Studio Code: Install latest VS Code version.
• Microsoft Fabric account: You need access to a Microsoft Fabric workspace. You can sign up for a free trial to get started.
• Python: Install Python 3.8 or later to work with Notebooks, User data functions in VS Code.

Installation and setup
----------------------
You can find and install the extensions from the Visual Studio Marketplace or directly in VS Code. Select the Extensions view (⇧⌘X (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+X)) and search for Microsoft Fabric.

Getting started
---------------
Once you have the extensions installed and signed in, you can start working with Fabric workspaces and items. In the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)), type Fabric to list the commands that are specific to Microsoft Fabric.




Fabric Workspace and items explorer
-----------------------------------
The Fabric extensions provide a seamless way to work with both remote and local Fabric items.

• In the Fabric extension, the Fabric Workspaces section lists all items from your remote workspace, organized by type (Lakehouses, Notebooks, Pipelines, and more).
• In the Fabric extension, the Local folder section shows a Fabric item(s) folder opened in VS Code. It reflects the structure of your fabric item definition for each type that is opened in VS Code. This enables you to develop locally and publish your changes to current or new workspace.



Use user data functions for data science
----------------------------------------
• In the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)), type Fabric: Create Item.
• Select your workspace and select User data function. Provide a name and select Python language.
• You are notified to set up the Python virtual environment and continue to set this up locally.
• Install the libraries using pip install or select the user data function item in the Fabric extension to add libraries. Update the requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies: fabric-user-data-functions ~= 1.0
pandas == 2.3.1
numpy == 2.3.2
requests == 2.32.5
scikit-learn=1.2.0
joblib=1.2.0
• Open functions_app.py. Here's an example of developing a User Data Function for data science using scikit-learn: import datetime
import fabric.functions as fn
import logging

# Import additional libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import joblib

udf = fn.UserDataFunctions()
@udf.function()
def train_churn_model(data: list, targetColumn: str) -> dict:
    '''
    Description: Train a Random Forest model to predict customer churn using pandas and scikit-learn.

    Args:
    - data (list): List of dictionaries containing customer features and churn target
    Example: [{"Age": 25, "Income": 50000, "Churn": 0}, {"Age": 45, "Income": 75000, "Churn": 1}]
    - targetColumn (str): Name of the target column for churn prediction
    Example: "Churn"

    # Convert data to DataFrame
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    X = df[numeric_features]
    y = df[targetColumn]

    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
    X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

    # Train model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

    # Evaluate and save
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, model.predict(X_test_scaled))
    joblib.dump(model, 'churn_model.pkl')
    joblib.dump(scaler, 'scaler.pkl')

    return {
        'accuracy': float(accuracy),
        'features': numeric_features,

    Returns: list: Customer data with churn predictions and probability scores
    '''
    # Load saved model and scaler
    model = joblib.load('churn_model.pkl')

    # Make predictions
    predictions = model.predict(X_scaled)
    probabilities = model.predict_proba(X_scaled)[:, 1]

    results = customer_data.copy()
    for i, (pred, prob) in enumerate(zip(predictions, probabilities)):
        results[i]['churn_prediction'] = int(pred)

• Test your functions locally, by pressing F5.
• In the Fabric extension, in Local folder , select the function and publish to your workspace.

Use Fabric notebooks for data science
-------------------------------------
A Fabric notebook is an interactive workbook in Microsoft Fabric for writing and running code, visualizations, and markdown side-by-side. Notebooks support multiple languages (Python, Spark, SQL, Scala, and more) and are ideal for data exploration, transformation, and model development in Fabric working with your existing data in OneLake.


Example
-------
The cell below reads a CSV with Spark, converts it to pandas, and trains a logistic regression model with scikit-learn. Replace column names and path with your dataset values.

[代码]
def train_logistic_from_spark(spark, csv_path):
    # Read CSV with Spark, convert to pandas
    sdf = spark.read.option("header", "true").option("inferSchema", "true").csv(csv_path)
    df = sdf.toPandas().dropna()

    # Adjust these to match your dataset
    X = df[['feature1', 'feature2']]
    y = df['label']

    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=200)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    preds = model.predict(X_test)
    return {'accuracy': float(accuracy_score(y_test, preds))}

# Example usage in a Fabric notebook cell
# train_logistic_from_spark(spark, '/path/to/data.csv')
[/代码]

Git integration
---------------
Microsoft Fabric supports Git integration that enables version control and collaboration across data and analytics projects. You can connect a Fabric workspace to Git repositories, primarily Azure DevOps or GitHub, and only supported items are synced. This integration also supports CI/CD workflow to enable teams to manage releases efficiently and maintain high-quality analytics environments.
