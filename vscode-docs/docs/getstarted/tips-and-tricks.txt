Basics
------

Getting started
---------------
The best way of exploring VS Code hands-on is to open the Welcome page and then pick a Walkthrough for a self-guided tour through the setup steps, features, and deeper customizations that VS Code offers. As you discover and learn, the walkthroughs track your progress.

Open the Welcome page from the Help > Welcome menu or use the Help: Welcome command from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)).



Extensions can also contribute walkthroughs. You can also directly open a walkthrough by using the Help: Open Walkthrough... command from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)).



If you are looking to improve your code editing skills, open the Interactive Editor Playground. Try out VS Code's code editing features, like multi-cursor editing, IntelliSense, Snippets, Emmet, and more.

Open the Welcome page from the Help > Editor Playground menu or use the Help: Interactive Editor Playground command from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)).




Command Palette
---------------
Access all available commands based on your current context.

Keyboard Shortcut: ⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)



Tip
You can move the Command Palette to another location by grabbing the top edge with the mouse cursor and dragging it somewhere else. You can also select the Customize Layout control in the title bar, and then select one of the preconfigured Quick Input Positions.




Default keyboard shortcuts
--------------------------
Many of the commands in the Command Palette have default keyboard shortcuts associated with them. You can see the default keyboard shortcut alongside the command in the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)).




Keyboard reference sheets
-------------------------
Download the keyboard shortcut reference sheet for your platform (macOS, Windows, Linux).




Floating windows
----------------
You can open an editor, the terminal, or specific views in a floating window, for example to move the editor to another place on your monitor or even to another monitor.



Drag an editor tab out of the current VS Code window to open it in a floating window. Alternatively, use the Move into New Window or Copy into New Window context options from the editor tab.


Integrated terminal
-------------------
Keyboard Shortcut: ⌃` (Windows, Linux Ctrl+`)



You can select another terminal shell from the dropdown. Depending on your operating system and system configuration, you might see different shells listed.

Command line
------------
VS Code has a powerful command line interface (CLI) which enables you to customize how the editor is launched to support various scenarios. For example, you can start VS Code from the command line to open a diff editor for comparing two files.

Make sure the VS Code binary is on your path so you can simply type 'code' to launch VS Code. See the platform specific setup topics if VS Code is added to your environment path during installation (Running VS Code on Linux, macOS, Windows).

[代码]
# open code with current directory
code .

# open the current directory in the most recently used code window
code -r .

# create a new window
code -n

# change the language
code --locale=es

# open diff editor
code --diff <file1> <file2>

# open file at specific line and column <file:line[:character]>
code --goto package.json:10:5

# see help options
code --help

# disable all extensions
code --disable-extensions .
[/代码]

.vscode folder
--------------
Workspace-specific configuration files are in a .vscode folder at the root of your workspace. For example, tasks.json for the Task Runner and launch.json for the debugger.


Status Bar
----------

Errors and warnings
-------------------
Keyboard Shortcut: ⇧⌘M (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+M)

Quickly jump to errors and warnings in the project.

Cycle through errors with F8 or ⇧F8 (Windows, Linux Shift+F8)



You can filter problem list either by type ('info', 'errors', 'warnings') or by matching text.


Change language mode
--------------------
The language mode in the Status Bar indicates the language (for example, Markdown, Python, and more) that is associated with the active editor. You can change the language mode for the current editor by selecting the Status Bar language mode indicator, or by using the keyboard shortcut.

Keyboard Shortcut: ⌘K M (Windows, Linux Ctrl+K M)



If you want to persist the new language mode for a file type, use the Configure File Association for command to associate the current file extension with an installed language.


Customization
-------------
There are many options to customize VS Code to meet your preferences:

• Change your theme
• Change your keyboard shortcuts

[代码]
"[languageid]": {

}
[/代码]
Tip: You can also create language-specific settings with the Configure Language Specific Settings command.




Add JSON validation
-------------------
JSON validation is enabled by default for many file types. Create your own schema and validation in settings.json:

[代码]
"json.schemas": [
    {
        "fileMatch": [
            "bower.json"
        ],
        "url": "https://json.schemastore.org/bower"
    }
]
[/代码]
or for a schema defined in your workspace:

[代码]
"json.schemas": [
    {
        "fileMatch": [
            "**/foo.json"
        ],
        "url": "./myschema.json"
    }
]
[/代码]
or to use a custom schema:

[代码]
"json.schemas": [
    {
        "fileMatch": [
            "/.myconfig"
        ],
        "schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "name" : {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The name of the entry"
                }
            }
        }
    }
]
[/代码]
See more in the JSON documentation.


Configure the default browser
-----------------------------
In VS Code, you can Ctrl+click (Cmd+click on macOS) on a link to open it in your default browser. You can configure the default browser by setting the

workbench.externalBrowser
• Open in VS Code
• Open in VS Code Insiders
setting (/docs/configure/settings).


Specify the full path to the browser executable as the settings value. Alternatively, to ensure correct functioning across devices, you can also use browser aliases, such as edge, chrome, or firefox.

[代码]
"workbench.externalBrowser": "edge"
[/代码]

Combine multiple logs into a single view
----------------------------------------
The Output panel shows the output of various services. Each services typically has their own log. To analyze related log information from multiple services, you can combine multiple logs into a single compound log.

Select Create Compound Log... from the overflow menu of the Output panel.

Files and folders
-----------------

Simple file dialog
------------------
With the simple file dialog, you can replace the system's default file dialog for opening and saving files and folders with a simpler Quick Pick dialog within VS Code.

Setting:

files.simpleDialog
• Open in VS Code
• Open in VS Code Insiders




Tip
Use the eye icon in the top right corner to show or hide files and folders starting with a dot.


Show Explorer view
------------------
Keyboard Shortcut: ⇧⌘E (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+E)


Quick Open
----------
Quickly search and open files.

Keyboard Shortcut: ⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+P)



Tip: Type ? to view command suggestions.



Typing commands such as edt or term followed by a space brings up a dropdown list.




Navigate between recently opened files
--------------------------------------
Repeatedly press the Quick Open keyboard shortcut to cycle quickly between recently opened files.


Open multiple files from Quick Open
-----------------------------------
You can open multiple files from Quick Open by pressing Right Arrow. This opens the currently selected file in the background, and you can continue selecting files from Quick Open.


Navigate between recently opened folders and workspaces
-------------------------------------------------------
Open a recent folder or workspace.

Keyboard Shortcut: ⌃R (Windows, Linux Ctrl+R)

Displays a Quick Pick dropdown with the list from File > Open Recent with recently opened folders and workspaces followed by files.


Create or open a file from a link
---------------------------------
Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl+click (Cmd+click on macOS)

You can quickly open a file or image, or create a new file by moving the cursor to the file link and then pressing Ctrl+click.




Close the currently opened folder
---------------------------------
Keyboard Shortcut: ⌘K F (Windows, Linux Ctrl+K F)


Navigation history
------------------
Navigate entire history: ⌃Tab (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Tab)

Navigate back: ⌃- (Windows Alt+Left, Linux Ctrl+Alt+-)

Navigate forward: ⌃⇧- (Windows Alt+Right, Linux Ctrl+Shift+-)




File associations
-----------------
Create language associations for files that aren't detected correctly. For example, many configuration files with custom file extensions are actually JSON.

[代码]
"files.associations": {
    ".database": "json"
}
[/代码]

Preventing dirty writes
-----------------------
VS Code will show you an error message when you try to save a file that cannot be saved because it has changed on disk. VS Code blocks saving the file to prevent overwriting changes that have been made outside of the editor.

To resolve the save conflict, select the Compare action in the notification popup to open a diff editor that shows you the contents of the file on disk (to the left) compared to the contents in VS Code (on the right):



Use the actions in the editor toolbar to resolve the save conflict. You can either Accept your changes and thereby overwriting any changes on disk, or Revert to the version on disk. Reverting means that your changes will be lost.

Note: The file remains dirty and cannot be saved until you pick one of the two actions to resolve the conflict.


Editing hacks
-------------
Here is a selection of common features for editing code. If you're more familiar with the keyboard shortcuts for another editor, consider installing a keymap extension.

Tip: You can see recommended keymap extensions in the Extensions view by filtering the search to @recommended:keymaps.


Side by side editing
--------------------
Keyboard Shortcut: ⌘\ (Windows, Linux Ctrl+\)

You can also drag and drop editors to create new editor groups and move editors between groups.




Switch between editors
----------------------
Keyboard Shortcut: ⌘1 (Windows, Linux Ctrl+1), ⌘2 (Windows, Linux Ctrl+2), ⌘3 (Windows, Linux Ctrl+3)




Multi cursor selection
----------------------
To add cursors at arbitrary positions, select a position with your mouse and use Alt+Click (Option+Click on macOS).

To set cursors above or below the current position use:

Keyboard Shortcut: ⌥⌘↑ (Windows Ctrl+Alt+Up, Linux Shift+Alt+Up) or ⌥⌘↓ (Windows Ctrl+Alt+Down, Linux Shift+Alt+Down)



You can add additional cursors to all occurrences of the current selection with ⇧⌘L (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+L).



Note: You can also change the modifier to Ctrl/Cmd for applying multiple cursors with the

editor.multiCursorModifier
• Open in VS Code
• Open in VS Code Insiders
setting (/docs/configure/settings). See
Multi-cursor Modifier (/docs/editing/codebasics#_multicursor-modifier)for details.


If you do not want to add all occurrences of the current selection, you can use ⌘D (Windows, Linux Ctrl+D) instead. This only selects the next occurrence after the one you selected so you can add selections one by one.




Column (box) selection
----------------------
You can select blocks of text by holding Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on macOS) while you drag your mouse. A separate cursor will be added to the end of each selected line.



You can also use keyboard shortcuts to trigger column selection.


Vertical rulers
---------------
You can add vertical column rulers to the editor with the

editor.rulers
• Open in VS Code
• Open in VS Code Insiders

Pressing the Alt key enables fast scrolling in the editor and Explorers. By default, fast scrolling uses a 5X speed multiplier but you can control the multiplier with the Editor: Fast Scroll Sensitivity (

editor.fastScrollSensitivity
• Open in VS Code
• Open in VS Code Insiders
) setting.



Locked scrolling
----------------
You can synchronize scrolling across all visible editors by using the View: Toggle Locked Scrolling Across Editors command. This means that when you scroll in one editor, all the other editors scroll by the same amount, keeping everything aligned.



You can choose to only activate the scrolling sync when you're holding down a specific keyboard shortcut. Set up a keyboard shortcut for the workbench.action.holdLockedScrolling command to temporarily lock scrolling across editors.


Copy line up / down
-------------------
Keyboard Shortcut: ⇧⌥↑ (Windows Shift+Alt+Up, Linux Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Up) or ⇧⌥↓ (Windows Shift+Alt+Down, Linux Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Down)

The commands Copy Line Up/Down are unbound on Linux because the VS Code default keyboard shortcuts would conflict with Ubuntu keyboard shortcuts, see Issue #509. You can still set the commands editor.action.copyLinesUpAction and editor.action.copyLinesDownAction to your own preferred keyboard shortcuts.




Move line up and down
---------------------
Keyboard Shortcut: ⌥↑ (Windows, Linux Alt+Up) or ⌥↓ (Windows, Linux Alt+Down)

Node.js support is built-in and other environments require installing the appropriate language extensions. See the debugging documentation for more details.




Breakpoints and stepping through
--------------------------------
Toggle a breakpoint by selecting the editor margin or by using F9 on the current line. Breakpoints in the editor margin are normally shown as red filled circles.

Once a debug session starts, the Debug toolbar appears on the top of the editor and enables you to step through or into the code while debugging. Learn more about debug actions in the debugging documentation.




Data inspection
---------------
Variables can be inspected in the VARIABLES section of the Run and Debug view, by hovering over their source in the editor, or by using the debug console.




Logpoints
---------
Logpoints act much like breakpoints but instead of halting the debugger when they are hit, they log a message to the console. Logpoints are especially useful for injecting logging while debugging production servers that cannot be modified or paused.

Add a logpoint with the Add Logpoint command in the left editor gutter and it will be displayed as a "diamond" shaped icon. Log messages are plain text but can include expressions to be evaluated within curly braces ('{}').




Triggered breakpoints
---------------------
A triggered breakpoint is a breakpoint that is automatically enabled once another breakpoint is hit. They can be very useful when diagnosing failure cases in code that happen only after a certain precondition.

Triggered breakpoints can be set by right-clicking on the glyph margin, selecting Add Triggered Breakpoint, and then choosing which other breakpoint enables the breakpoint.




Task runner
-----------
Tasks in VS Code can be configured to run scripts and start processes so that these tools can be used from within VS Code without having to enter a command line or write new code.


Auto detect tasks
-----------------
Select Terminal from the top-level menu, run the command Configure Tasks, then select the type of task you'd like to run. This generates a tasks.json file with content like the following. See the Tasks documentation for more details.

[代码]
{
  // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
  // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "npm",
      "script": "install",
      "group": {
        "kind": "build",
        "isDefault": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
[/代码]
There are occasionally issues with auto generation. Check out the documentation for getting things to work properly.


Run tasks from the Terminal menu
--------------------------------
Select Terminal from the top-level menu, run the command Run Task, and select the task you want to run. Terminate the running task by running the command Terminate Task




Define keyboard shortcuts for tasks
-----------------------------------
You can define a keyboard shortcut for any task. From the Command Palette (⇧⌘P (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+P)), select Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts File, bind the desired shortcut to the workbench.action.tasks.runTask command, and define the Task as args.

For example, to bind Ctrl+H to the Run tests task, add the following:

[代码]
{
  "key": "ctrl+h",
  "command": "workbench.action.tasks.runTask",
  "args": "Run tests"
}
[/代码]

Run npm scripts as tasks from the Explorer
------------------------------------------
From the Explorer view you can open a script in the editor, run it as a task, and launch it with the node debugger (when the script defines a debug option like --inspect-brk). The default action on click is to open the script. To run a script on a single click, set

npm.scriptExplorerAction
• Open in VS Code
• Open in VS Code Insiders
to
[代码]
run
[/代码]
. Use the setting
npm.exclude
• Open in VS Code
• Open in VS Code Insiders
to exclude scripts in
[代码]
package.json
[/代码]
files contained in particular folders.




With the setting

npm.enableRunFromFolder
• Open in VS Code
• Open in VS Code Insiders
, you can enable to run npm scripts from the Explorer view context menu for a folder. The setting enables the command
Run NPM Script in Folder...
when a folder is selected. The command shows a Quick Pick list of the npm scripts contained in this folder and you can select the script to be executed as a task.



Portable mode
-------------
VS Code has a Portable mode which lets you keep settings and data in the same location as your installation, for example, on a USB drive.


Insiders builds
---------------
The Visual Studio Code team uses the Insiders version to test the latest features and bug fixes of VS Code. You can also use the Insiders version by downloading it here.

• For Early Adopters - Insiders has the most recent code changes for users and extension authors to try out.
• Frequent Builds - New builds every day with the latest bug fixes and features.
• Side-by-side install - Insiders installs next to the Stable build allowing you to use either independently.
