Use extensions in Visual Studio Code
====================================

Use extensions in Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code extensions let you add languages, debuggers, and tools to your installation to support your development workflow. When you use VS Code, you can install extensions directly from the Visual Studio Marketplace and take advantage of automatic updates to always have the latest features. In this article, you learn how to browse and install extensions in VS Code.

The Visual Studio Marketplace hosts thousands of extensions across a wide range of categories. To protect you from malicious extensions, it employs several mechanisms, like publisher trust, malware scanning, and more. Learn more about extension runtime security.


Browse extensions
-----------------
The Extensions view in VS Code enables you to browse and install extensions from the Visual Studio Marketplace.

To browse the extension Marketplace from within VS Code:

• Open the Extensions view by selecting the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar, or use the ⇧⌘X (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+X) keyboard shortcut.
• Optionally, search for an extension by using the search box or use one of the filters. For example, to filter by extension category.
• Select an extension to view its details, such as its description, publisher, install count, user rating, and more.

Install a VS Code extension
---------------------------
You can install an extension directly from the Extensions view in VS Code. Alternatively, you can install an extension from the Visual Studio Marketplace website.

• Open the Extensions view (⇧⌘X (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+X)).
• Select the Install button on the extension's tile.
• You can also select the Install button on the extension's details view.
Tip
If you have to switch between different technology stacks, use VS Code profiles to only install the extensions you need for a given workload. For example, you can install extensions for web development in one profile and extensions for data science in another profile.


Open extension settings
-----------------------
Extensions can also contribute settings to VS Code. Use the Settings editor to view and modify these settings like you would for other settings in VS Code.

• Open the Settings editor via the File > Preferences > Settings menu or use the ⌘, (Windows, Linux Ctrl+,) keyboard shortcut.
• In the settings tree view, select Extensions, and then select the specific extension to see its settings.

Uninstall a VS Code extension
-----------------------------
You can uninstall an extension from the Extensions view in VS Code. If you want to temporarily disable an extension, you might choose to disable the extension instead of uninstalling it.

• Open the Extensions view (⇧⌘X (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Shift+X)).
• Select the gear icon or right-click on the extension's tile, and then select Uninstall.
