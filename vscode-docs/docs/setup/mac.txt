Install VS Code on macOS
------------------------
• Download Visual Studio Code for macOS.
• Open the downloaded .dmg file
• Drag Visual Studio Code.app to the Applications folder
• Open VS Code from the Applications folder, by double clicking the icon.
• Add VS Code to your Dock by right-clicking on the icon, located in the Dock, to bring up the context menu and choosing Options, Keep in Dock.

Launch VS Code from the command line
------------------------------------
To run VS Code from the terminal by typing code, add it to the $PATH environment variable using one of the following methods:


Configure the path with VS Code
-------------------------------
• Launch VS Code
• Open the Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P), type 'shell command', and run the Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH command.
• Restart the terminal for the new $PATH value to take effect. You can now type 'code .' in any folder to start editing files in that folder.
Note
If you still have the old code alias in your .bash_profile (or equivalent) from an early VS Code version, remove it and replace it by running the Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH command.


Manually configure the path
---------------------------
To manually add VS Code to your path:

• Run the following commands: Zsh: cat << EOF >> ~/.zprofile
# Add Visual Studio Code (code)
export PATH="\$PATH:/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin"
EOF
 Bash: cat << EOF >> ~/.bash_profile
# Add Visual Studio Code (code)
export PATH="\$PATH:/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin"
EOF
 Note The leading slash \ is required to prevent $PATH from expanding during the concatenation. Remove the leading slash if you want to run the export command directly in a terminal.
• Start a new terminal to pick up your changes. You can now type 'code .' in any folder to start editing files in that folder.

Updates
-------
VS Code ships monthly releases and supports auto-update when a new release is available. If you're prompted by VS Code, accept the newest update and it will get installed (you won't need to do anything else to get the latest bits).

Note
You can disable auto-update if you prefer to update VS Code on your own schedule.


Touch Bar support
-----------------
Out of the box, VS Code adds the following Touch Bar actions:

• To navigate in the editor history
• The full Debug tool bar to control the debugger on your Touch Bar:



Mojave privacy protections
--------------------------
On macOS Mojave, you might see dialogs saying "Visual Studio Code would like to access your {calendar/contacts/photos}." This is due to the new privacy protections in Mojave and is not specific to VS Code. The same dialogs might be displayed when running other applications as well. The dialog is shown once for each type of personal data and it is fine to choose Don't Allow, since VS Code does not need access to those folders.
