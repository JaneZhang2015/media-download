Model Catalog (/docs/intelligentapps/models)Discover and access AI models from multiple sources including GitHub, ONNX, Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Compare models side-by-side and find the perfect fit for your use case.
Playground (/docs/intelligentapps/playground)Interactive chat environment for real-time model testing. Experiment with different prompts, parameters, and multi-modal inputs including images and attachments.
Agent Builder (/docs/intelligentapps/agentbuilder)Streamlined prompt engineering and agent development workflow. Create sophisticated prompts, integrate MCP tools, and generate production-ready code with structured outputs.
Bulk Run (/docs/intelligentapps/bulkrun)Execute batch prompt testing across multiple models simultaneously. Ideal for comparing model performance and testing at scale with various input scenarios.
Model Evaluation (/docs/intelligentapps/evaluation)Comprehensive model assessment using datasets and standard metrics. Measure performance with built-in evaluators (F1 score, relevance, similarity, coherence) or create custom evaluation criteria.
Fine-tuning (/docs/intelligentapps/finetune)Customize and adapt models for specific domains and requirements. Train models locally with GPU support or leverage Azure Container Apps for cloud-based fine-tuning.
Model Conversion (/docs/intelligentapps/modelconversion)Convert, quantize, and optimize machine learning models for local deployment. Transform models from Hugging Face and other sources to run efficiently on Windows with CPU, GPU, or NPU acceleration.
Tracing (/docs/intelligentapps/tracing)Monitor and analyze the performance of your AI applications. Collect and visualize trace data to gain insights into model behavior and performance.
Profiling (Windows ML) (/docs/intelligentapps/profiling)Diagnose the CPU, GPU, NPU resource usages of the process, ONNX model on different execution providers, and Windows Machine Learning events.

Explore AI Toolkit
------------------
AI Toolkit opens in its own view, with the AI Toolkit icon now displayed on the VS Code Activity Bar. The extension has several main sections: My Resources, Model Tools, Agent and Workflow Tools, MCP Workflow, and Help and Feedback.



• My Resources: This section contains the resources you have access to in AI Toolkit. The My Resources section is the main view for interacting with your Azure AI resources. It contains the following subsections: Models: This section contains the models you can use to build and deploy for your AI applications. The Models view is where you can find your deployed models in AI Toolkit. Agents: This section contains your AI Toolkit deployed agents. MCP Servers: This section contains the MCP Servers you're working with in AI Toolkit.
• Model Tools: This section contains the model tools you can use to build and deploy your AI applications. The Model Tools view is where you can find the tools available to deploy and then work with your deployed models. It contains the following subsections: Model Catalog: The model catalog lets you discover and access AI models from multiple sources including GitHub, ONNX, Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Compare models side-by-side and find the right model for your use case. Model Playground: The model playground provides an interactive environment to experiment with generative AI models. Test various prompts, adjust model parameters, compare responses from different models and explore multi-modal capabilities by attaching different types of input files. Conversion: The model conversion tool helps you convert, quantize, optimize, and evaluate the pre-built machine learning models on your local Windows platform. Fine-tuning: This tool allows you to use your custom dataset to run fine-tuning jobs on a pre-trained model in a local computing environment with GPU or in the cloud (Azure Container Apps) with GPU.
• Agent and Workflow Tools: This section is where you can find the tools available to deploy and then work with your deployed agents in AI Toolkit. It contains the following subsections: Agent Builder: Create and deploy agents easily. Bulk Run: Test agents and prompts against multiple test cases in batch mode. Evaluation: Evaluate models, prompts, and agents by comparing their outputs to ground truth data and computing evaluation metrics.
