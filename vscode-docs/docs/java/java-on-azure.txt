Deploy Java Web Apps
====================

Deploy Java Web Apps
The Azure Tools extension pack contains a rich set of extensions that make it easy to discover and interact with the cloud services that power your Java applications.

The extension pack supports the following development workflows:

• Deploy Java applications (including containers) to Azure App Service.
• Deploy Spring microservices to Azure Spring Cloud.
• Deploy serverless code to Azure Functions.


If you are interested in a specific Azure service, you can also directly search for it on the Visual Studio Code Marketplace to see if there's an available extension.
