Claude Code overview
Copy page
Claude Code is an agentic coding tool that reads your codebase, edits files, runs commands, and integrates with your development tools. Available in your terminal, IDE, desktop app, and browser.
Copy page
Claude Code is an AI-powered coding assistant that helps you build features, fix bugs, and automate development tasks. It understands your entire codebase and can work across multiple files and tools to get things done.
(#get-started) ​
Get started
Choose your environment to get started. Most surfaces require a  (https://claude.com/pricing) Claude subscription or  (https://console.anthropic.com/) Anthropic Console account. The Terminal CLI and VS Code also support  (/docs/en/third-party-integrations) third-party providers .

You’ll be prompted to log in on first use. That’s it!  (/docs/en/quickstart) Continue with the Quickstart →
See  (/docs/en/setup) advanced setup for installation options, manual updates, or uninstallation instructions. Visit  (/docs/en/troubleshooting) troubleshooting if you hit issues.
The VS Code extension provides inline diffs, @-mentions, plan review, and conversation history directly in your editor.

(#what-you-can-do) ​
What you can do
Here are some of the ways you can use Claude Code:
Automate the work you keep putting off
Claude Code handles the tedious tasks that eat up your day: writing tests for untested code, fixing lint errors across a project, resolving merge conflicts, updating dependencies, and writing release notes.
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
claude "write tests for the auth module, run them, and fix any failures"
Build features and fix bugs
Describe what you want in plain language. Claude Code plans the approach, writes the code across multiple files, and verifies it works. For bugs, paste an error message or describe the symptom. Claude Code traces the issue through your codebase, identifies the root cause, and implements a fix. See  (/docs/en/common-workflows) common workflows for more examples.
Create commits and pull requests
Claude Code works directly with git. It stages changes, writes commit messages, creates branches, and opens pull requests.
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
claude "commit my changes with a descriptive message"
In CI, you can automate code review and issue triage with  (/docs/en/github-actions) GitHub Actions or  (/docs/en/gitlab-ci-cd) GitLab CI/CD .
Connect your tools with MCP
The  (/docs/en/mcp) Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI tools to external data sources. With MCP, Claude Code can read your design docs in Google Drive, update tickets in Jira, pull data from Slack, or use your own custom tooling.
Customize with instructions, skills, and hooks
(/docs/en/claude-md) CLAUDE.md is a markdown file you add to your project root that Claude Code reads at the start of every session. Use it to set coding standards, architecture decisions, preferred libraries, and review checklists. Create  (/docs/en/skills) custom slash commands to package repeatable workflows your team can share, like /review-pr or /deploy-staging .  (/docs/en/hooks) Hooks let you run shell commands before or after Claude Code actions, like auto-formatting after every file edit or running lint before a commit.
Run agent teams and build custom agents
Spawn  (/docs/en/sub-agents) multiple Claude Code agents that work on different parts of a task simultaneously. A lead agent coordinates the work, assigns subtasks, and merges results. For fully custom workflows, the  (https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) Agent SDK lets you build your own agents powered by Claude Code’s tools and capabilities, with full control over orchestration, tool access, and permissions.
Pipe, script, and automate with the CLI
Claude Code is composable and follows the Unix philosophy. Pipe logs into it, run it in CI, or chain it with other tools:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
# Monitor logs and get alerted tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see any anomalies" # Automate translations in CI claude -p "translate new strings into French and raise a PR for review" # Bulk operations across files git diff main --name-only | claude -p "review these changed files for security issues"
See the  (/docs/en/cli-reference) CLI reference for the full set of commands and flags.
Work from anywhere
Sessions aren’t tied to a single surface. Move work between environments as your context changes:
Kick off a long-running task on the  (/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web) web or  (https://apps.apple.com/app/claude-by-anthropic/id6473753684) iOS app , then pull it into your terminal with /teleport
Hand off a terminal session to the  (/docs/en/desktop) Desktop app with /desktop for visual diff review
Route tasks from team chat: mention @Claude in  (/docs/en/slack) Slack with a bug report and get a pull request back
(#use-claude-code-everywhere) ​
Use Claude Code everywhere
Each surface connects to the same underlying Claude Code engine, so your CLAUDE.md files, settings, and MCP servers work across all of them. Beyond the  (/docs/en/quickstart) Terminal ,  (/docs/en/vs-code) VS Code ,  (/docs/en/jetbrains) JetBrains ,  (/docs/en/desktop) Desktop , and  (/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web) Web environments above, Claude Code integrates with CI/CD, chat, and browser workflows:
I want to… Best option
Start a task locally, continue on mobile  (/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web) Web or  (https://apps.apple.com/app/claude-by-anthropic/id6473753684) Claude iOS app
Automate PR reviews and issue triage  (/docs/en/github-actions) GitHub Actions or  (/docs/en/gitlab-ci-cd) GitLab CI/CD
Route bug reports from Slack to pull requests  (/docs/en/slack) Slack
Debug live web applications  (/docs/en/chrome) Chrome
Build custom agents for your own workflows  (https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) Agent SDK
