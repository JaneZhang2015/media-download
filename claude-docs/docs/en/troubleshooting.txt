Common installation issues
(#windows-installation-issues-errors-in-wsl) ​
Windows installation issues: errors in WSL
You might encounter the following issues in WSL: OS/platform detection issues : If you receive an error during installation, WSL may be using Windows npm . Try:
Run npm config set os linux before installation
Install with npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code --force --no-os-check (Do NOT use sudo )
Node not found errors : If you see exec: node: not found when running claude , your WSL environment may be using a Windows installation of Node.js. You can confirm this with which npm and which node , which should point to Linux paths starting with /usr/ rather than /mnt/c/ . To fix this, try installing Node via your Linux distribution’s package manager or via  (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) nvm . nvm version conflicts : If you have nvm installed in both WSL and Windows, you may experience version conflicts when switching Node versions in WSL. This happens because WSL imports the Windows PATH by default, causing Windows nvm/npm to take priority over the WSL installation. You can identify this issue by:
Running which npm and which node - if they point to Windows paths (starting with /mnt/c/ ), Windows versions are being used
Experiencing broken functionality after switching Node versions with nvm in WSL
To resolve this issue, fix your Linux PATH to ensure the Linux node/npm versions take priority: Primary solution: Ensure nvm is properly loaded in your shell The most common cause is that nvm isn’t loaded in non-interactive shells. Add the following to your shell configuration file ( ~/.bashrc , ~/.zshrc , etc.):
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
# Load nvm if it exists export NVM_DIR = " $HOME /.nvm" [ -s " $NVM_DIR /nvm.sh" ] && \. " $NVM_DIR /nvm.sh" [ -s " $NVM_DIR /bash_completion" ] && \. " $NVM_DIR /bash_completion"
Or run directly in your current session:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
Alternative: Adjust PATH order If nvm is properly loaded but Windows paths still take priority, you can explicitly prepend your Linux paths to PATH in your shell configuration:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
export PATH = " $HOME /.nvm/versions/node/$( node -v )/bin: $PATH "
Avoid disabling Windows PATH importing ( appendWindowsPath = false ) as this breaks the ability to call Windows executables from WSL. Similarly, avoid uninstalling Node.js from Windows if you use it for Windows development.
(#wsl2-sandbox-setup) ​
WSL2 sandbox setup
(/docs/en/sandboxing) Sandboxing is supported on WSL2 but requires installing additional packages. If you see an error like “Sandbox requires socat and bubblewrap” when running /sandbox , install the dependencies:
Ubuntu/Debian
Fedora
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
sudo apt-get install bubblewrap socat
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
sudo dnf install bubblewrap socat
WSL1 does not support sandboxing. If you see “Sandboxing requires WSL2”, you need to upgrade to WSL2 or run Claude Code without sandboxing.
(#linux-and-mac-installation-issues-permission-or-command-not-found-errors) ​
Linux and Mac installation issues: permission or command not found errors
When installing Claude Code with npm, PATH problems may prevent access to claude .
You may also encounter permission errors if your npm global prefix is not user writable (for example, /usr , or /usr/local ).
(#recommended-solution-native-claude-code-installation) ​
Recommended solution: Native Claude Code installation
Claude Code has a native installation that doesn’t depend on npm or Node.js. Use the following command to run the native installer. macOS, Linux, WSL:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
# Install stable version (default) curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash # Install latest version curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash -s latest # Install specific version number curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash -s 1.0.58
Windows PowerShell:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
# Install stable version (default) irm https: // claude.ai / install.ps1 | iex # Install latest version & ([ scriptblock ]::Create((irm https: // claude.ai / install.ps1))) latest # Install specific version number & ([ scriptblock ]::Create((irm https: // claude.ai / install.ps1))) 1.0 . 58
This command installs the appropriate build of Claude Code for your operating system and architecture and adds a symlink to the installation at ~/.local/bin/claude (or %USERPROFILE%\.local\bin\claude.exe on Windows).
Make sure that you have the installation directory in your system PATH.
(#windows-“claude-code-on-windows-requires-git-bash”) ​
Windows: “Claude Code on Windows requires git-bash”
Claude Code on native Windows requires  (https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) Git for Windows which includes Git Bash. If Git is installed but not detected:
Set the path explicitly in PowerShell before running Claude:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
$ env: CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH = "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"
Or add it to your system environment variables permanently through System Properties → Environment Variables.
If Git is installed in a non-standard location, adjust the path accordingly.
(#windows-“installmethod-is-native-but-claude-command-not-found”) ​
Windows: “installMethod is native, but claude command not found”
If you see this error after installation, the claude command isn’t in your PATH. Add it manually:
1
(#)
Open Environment Variables
Press Win + R , type sysdm.cpl , and press Enter. Click Advanced → Environment Variables .
2
(#)
Edit User PATH
Under “User variables”, select Path and click Edit . Click New and add:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin
3
(#)
Restart your terminal
Close and reopen PowerShell or CMD for changes to take effect.
Verify installation:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
claude doctor # Check installation health
(#permissions-and-authentication) ​
Permissions and authentication
(#repeated-permission-prompts) ​
Repeated permission prompts
If you find yourself repeatedly approving the same commands, you can allow specific tools
to run without approval using the /permissions command. See  (/docs/en/permissions#manage-permissions) Permissions docs .
(#authentication-issues) ​
Authentication issues
If you’re experiencing authentication problems:
Run /logout to sign out completely
Close Claude Code
Restart with claude and complete the authentication process again
If the browser doesn’t open automatically during login, press c to copy the OAuth URL to your clipboard, then paste it into your browser manually. If problems persist, try:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
rm -rf ~/.config/claude-code/auth.json claude
This removes your stored authentication information and forces a clean login.
(#configuration-file-locations) ​
Configuration file locations
Claude Code stores configuration in several locations:
File Purpose
~/.claude/settings.json User settings (permissions, hooks, model overrides)
.claude/settings.json Project settings (checked into source control)
.claude/settings.local.json Local project settings (not committed)
~/.claude.json Global state (theme, OAuth, MCP servers)
.mcp.json Project MCP servers (checked into source control)
managed-settings.json  (/docs/en/settings#settings-files) Managed settings
managed-mcp.json  (/docs/en/mcp#managed-mcp-configuration) Managed MCP servers
On Windows, ~ refers to your user home directory, such as C:\Users\YourName . Managed file locations:
macOS: /Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/
Linux/WSL: /etc/claude-code/
Windows: C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\
For details on configuring these files, see  (/docs/en/settings) Settings and  (/docs/en/mcp) MCP .
(#resetting-configuration) ​
Resetting configuration
To reset Claude Code to default settings, you can remove the configuration files:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
# Reset all user settings and state rm ~/.claude.json rm -rf ~/.claude/ # Reset project-specific settings rm -rf .claude/ rm .mcp.json
This will remove all your settings, MCP server configurations, and session history.
(#performance-and-stability) ​
Performance and stability
(#high-cpu-or-memory-usage) ​
High CPU or memory usage
Claude Code is designed to work with most development environments, but may consume significant resources when processing large codebases. If you’re experiencing performance issues:
Use /compact regularly to reduce context size
Close and restart Claude Code between major tasks
Consider adding large build directories to your .gitignore file
(#command-hangs-or-freezes) ​
Command hangs or freezes
If Claude Code seems unresponsive:
Press Ctrl+C to attempt to cancel the current operation
If unresponsive, you may need to close the terminal and restart
(#search-and-discovery-issues) ​
Search and discovery issues
If Search tool, @file mentions, custom agents, and custom skills aren’t working, install system ripgrep :
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
# macOS (Homebrew) brew install ripgrep # Windows (winget) winget install BurntSushi.ripgrep.MSVC # Ubuntu/Debian sudo apt install ripgrep # Alpine Linux apk add ripgrep # Arch Linux pacman -S ripgrep
Then set USE_BUILTIN_RIPGREP=0 in your  (/docs/en/settings#environment-variables) environment .
(#slow-or-incomplete-search-results-on-wsl) ​
Slow or incomplete search results on WSL
Disk read performance penalties when  (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/filesystems) working across file systems on WSL may result in fewer-than-expected matches (but not a complete lack of search functionality) when using Claude Code on WSL.
/doctor will show Search as OK in this case.
Solutions:
Submit more specific searches : Reduce the number of files searched by specifying directories or file types: “Search for JWT validation logic in the auth-service package” or “Find use of md5 hash in JS files”.
Move project to Linux filesystem : If possible, ensure your project is located on the Linux filesystem ( /home/ ) rather than the Windows filesystem ( /mnt/c/ ).
Use native Windows instead : Consider running Claude Code natively on Windows instead of through WSL, for better file system performance.
(#ide-integration-issues) ​
IDE integration issues
(#jetbrains-ide-not-detected-on-wsl2) ​
JetBrains IDE not detected on WSL2
If you’re using Claude Code on WSL2 with JetBrains IDEs and getting “No available IDEs detected” errors, this is likely due to WSL2’s networking configuration or Windows Firewall blocking the connection.
(#wsl2-networking-modes) ​
WSL2 networking modes
WSL2 uses NAT networking by default, which can prevent IDE detection. You have two options: Option 1: Configure Windows Firewall (recommended)
Find your WSL2 IP address:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
wsl hostname -I # Example output: 172.21.123.456
Open PowerShell as Administrator and create a firewall rule:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
New-NetFirewallRule - DisplayName "Allow WSL2 Internal Traffic" - Direction Inbound - Protocol TCP - Action Allow - RemoteAddress 172.21 . 0.0 / 16 - LocalAddress 172.21 . 0.0 / 16
(Adjust the IP range based on your WSL2 subnet from step 1)
Restart both your IDE and Claude Code
Option 2: Switch to mirrored networking Add to .wslconfig in your Windows user directory:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
[wsl2] networkingMode =mirrored
Then restart WSL with wsl --shutdown from PowerShell.
These networking issues only affect WSL2. WSL1 uses the host’s network directly and doesn’t require these configurations.
For additional JetBrains configuration tips, see our  (/docs/en/jetbrains#plugin-settings) JetBrains IDE guide .
(#reporting-windows-ide-integration-issues-both-native-and-wsl) ​
Reporting Windows IDE integration issues (both native and WSL)
If you’re experiencing IDE integration problems on Windows,  (https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues) create an issue with the following information:
Environment type: native Windows (Git Bash) or WSL1/WSL2
WSL networking mode (if applicable): NAT or mirrored
IDE name and version
Claude Code extension/plugin version
Shell type: Bash, Zsh, PowerShell, etc.
(#escape-key-not-working-in-jetbrains-intellij-pycharm-etc-terminals) ​
Escape key not working in JetBrains (IntelliJ, PyCharm, etc.) terminals
If you’re using Claude Code in JetBrains terminals and the Esc key doesn’t interrupt the agent as expected, this is likely due to a keybinding clash with JetBrains’ default shortcuts. To fix this issue:
Go to Settings → Tools → Terminal
Either:
Uncheck “Move focus to the editor with Escape”, or
Click “Configure terminal keybindings” and delete the “Switch focus to Editor” shortcut
Apply the changes
This allows the Esc key to properly interrupt Claude Code operations.
(#markdown-formatting-issues) ​
Markdown formatting issues
Claude Code sometimes generates markdown files with missing language tags on code fences, which can affect syntax highlighting and readability in GitHub, editors, and documentation tools.
(#missing-language-tags-in-code-blocks) ​
Missing language tags in code blocks
If you notice code blocks like this in generated markdown:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
``` function example() { return "hello"; } ```
Instead of properly tagged blocks like:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
```javascript function example () { return "hello" ; } ```
Solutions:
Ask Claude to add language tags : Request “Add appropriate language tags to all code blocks in this markdown file.”
Use post-processing hooks : Set up automatic formatting hooks to detect and add missing language tags. See  (/docs/en/hooks-guide#auto-format-code-after-edits) Auto-format code after edits for an example of a PostToolUse formatting hook.
Manual verification : After generating markdown files, review them for proper code block formatting and request corrections if needed.
(#inconsistent-spacing-and-formatting) ​
Inconsistent spacing and formatting
If generated markdown has excessive blank lines or inconsistent spacing: Solutions:
Request formatting corrections : Ask Claude to “Fix spacing and formatting issues in this markdown file.”
Use formatting tools : Set up hooks to run markdown formatters like prettier or custom formatting scripts on generated markdown files.
Specify formatting preferences : Include formatting requirements in your prompts or project  (/docs/en/memory) memory files.
(#best-practices-for-markdown-generation) ​
Best practices for markdown generation
To minimize formatting issues:
Be explicit in requests : Ask for “properly formatted markdown with language-tagged code blocks”
Use project conventions : Document your preferred markdown style in  (/docs/en/memory) CLAUDE.md
Set up validation hooks : Use post-processing hooks to automatically verify and fix common formatting issues
