Platforms and integrations
Use Claude Code with Chrome (beta)
Copy page
Connect Claude Code to your Chrome browser to test web apps, debug with console logs, automate form filling, and extract data from web pages.
Copy page
Claude Code integrates with the Claude in Chrome browser extension to give you browser automation capabilities from the CLI or the  (/docs/en/vs-code#automate-browser-tasks-with-chrome) VS Code extension . Build your code, then test and debug in the browser without switching contexts. Claude opens new tabs for browser tasks and shares your browser’s login state, so it can access any site you’re already signed into. Browser actions run in a visible Chrome window in real time. When Claude encounters a login page or CAPTCHA, it pauses and asks you to handle it manually.
Chrome integration is in beta and currently works with Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. It is not yet supported on Brave, Arc, or other Chromium-based browsers. WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is also not supported.
(#capabilities) ​
Capabilities
With Chrome connected, you can chain browser actions with coding tasks in a single workflow:
Live debugging : read console errors and DOM state directly, then fix the code that caused them
Design verification : build a UI from a Figma mock, then open it in the browser to verify it matches
Web app testing : test form validation, check for visual regressions, or verify user flows
Authenticated web apps : interact with Google Docs, Gmail, Notion, or any app you’re logged into without API connectors
Data extraction : pull structured information from web pages and save it locally
Task automation : automate repetitive browser tasks like data entry, form filling, or multi-site workflows
Session recording : record browser interactions as GIFs to document or share what happened
(#prerequisites) ​
Prerequisites
Before using Claude Code with Chrome, you need:
(https://www.google.com/chrome/) Google Chrome or  (https://www.microsoft.com/edge) Microsoft Edge browser
(https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/claude/fcoeoabgfenejglbffodgkkbkcdhcgfn) Claude in Chrome extension version 1.0.36 or higher, available in the Chrome Web Store for both browsers
(/docs/en/quickstart#step-1-install-claude-code) Claude Code version 2.0.73 or higher
A direct Anthropic plan (Pro, Max, Teams, or Enterprise)
Chrome integration is not available through third-party providers like Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry. If you access Claude exclusively through a third-party provider, you need a separate claude.ai account to use this feature.
(#get-started-in-the-cli) ​
Get started in the CLI
1
(#)
Launch Claude Code with Chrome
Start Claude Code with the --chrome flag:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
claude --chrome
You can also enable Chrome from within an existing session by running /chrome .
2
(#)
Ask Claude to use the browser
This example navigates to a page, interacts with it, and reports what it finds, all from your terminal or editor:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
Go to code.claude.com/docs, click on the search box, type "hooks", and tell me what results appear
Run /chrome at any time to check the connection status, manage permissions, or reconnect the extension. For VS Code, see  (/docs/en/vs-code#automate-browser-tasks-with-chrome) browser automation in VS Code .
(#enable-chrome-by-default) ​
Enable Chrome by default
To avoid passing --chrome each session, run /chrome and select “Enabled by default”. In the  (/docs/en/vs-code#automate-browser-tasks-with-chrome) VS Code extension , Chrome is available whenever the Chrome extension is installed. No additional flag is needed.
Enabling Chrome by default in the CLI increases context usage since browser tools are always loaded. If you notice increased context consumption, disable this setting and use --chrome only when needed.
(#manage-site-permissions) ​
Manage site permissions
Site-level permissions are inherited from the Chrome extension. Manage permissions in the Chrome extension settings to control which sites Claude can browse, click, and type on.
(#example-workflows) ​
Example workflows
These examples show common ways to combine browser actions with coding tasks. Run /mcp and select claude-in-chrome to see the full list of available browser tools.
(#test-a-local-web-application) ​
Test a local web application
When developing a web app, ask Claude to verify your changes work correctly:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
I just updated the login form validation. Can you open localhost:3000, try submitting the form with invalid data, and check if the error messages appear correctly?
Claude navigates to your local server, interacts with the form, and reports what it observes.
(#debug-with-console-logs) ​
Debug with console logs
Claude can read console output to help diagnose problems. Tell Claude what patterns to look for rather than asking for all console output, since logs can be verbose:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
Open the dashboard page and check the console for any errors when the page loads.
Claude reads the console messages and can filter for specific patterns or error types.
(#automate-form-filling) ​
Automate form filling
Speed up repetitive data entry tasks:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
I have a spreadsheet of customer contacts in contacts.csv. For each row, go to the CRM at crm.example.com, click "Add Contact", and fill in the name, email, and phone fields.
Claude reads your local file, navigates the web interface, and enters the data for each record.
(#draft-content-in-google-docs) ​
Draft content in Google Docs
Use Claude to write directly in your documents without API setup:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
Draft a project update based on the recent commits and add it to my Google Doc at docs.google.com/document/d/abc123
Claude opens the document, clicks into the editor, and types the content. This works with any web app you’re logged into: Gmail, Notion, Sheets, and more.
(#extract-data-from-web-pages) ​
Extract data from web pages
Pull structured information from websites:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
Go to the product listings page and extract the name, price, and availability for each item. Save the results as a CSV file.
Claude navigates to the page, reads the content, and compiles the data into a structured format.
(#run-multi-site-workflows) ​
Run multi-site workflows
Coordinate tasks across multiple websites:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
Check my calendar for meetings tomorrow, then for each meeting with an external attendee, look up their company website and add a note about what they do.
Claude works across tabs to gather information and complete the workflow.
(#record-a-demo-gif) ​
Record a demo GIF
Create shareable recordings of browser interactions:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
Record a GIF showing how to complete the checkout flow, from adding an item to the cart through to the confirmation page.
Claude records the interaction sequence and saves it as a GIF file.
(#troubleshooting) ​
Troubleshooting
(#extension-not-detected) ​
Extension not detected
If Claude Code shows “Chrome extension not detected”:
Verify the Chrome extension is installed and enabled in chrome://extensions
Verify Claude Code is up to date by running claude --version
Check that Chrome is running
Run /chrome and select “Reconnect extension” to re-establish the connection
If the issue persists, restart both Claude Code and Chrome
The first time you enable Chrome integration, Claude Code installs a native messaging host configuration file. Chrome reads this file on startup, so if the extension isn’t detected on your first attempt, restart Chrome to pick up the new configuration. If the connection still fails, verify the host configuration file exists at: For Chrome:
macOS : ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.anthropic.claude_code_browser_extension.json
Linux : ~/.config/google-chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.anthropic.claude_code_browser_extension.json
Windows : check HKCU\Software\Google\Chrome\NativeMessagingHosts\ in the Windows Registry
For Edge:
macOS : ~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft Edge/NativeMessagingHosts/com.anthropic.claude_code_browser_extension.json
Linux : ~/.config/microsoft-edge/NativeMessagingHosts/com.anthropic.claude_code_browser_extension.json
Windows : check HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Edge\NativeMessagingHosts\ in the Windows Registry
(#browser-not-responding) ​
Browser not responding
If Claude’s browser commands stop working:
Check if a modal dialog (alert, confirm, prompt) is blocking the page. JavaScript dialogs block browser events and prevent Claude from receiving commands. Dismiss the dialog manually, then tell Claude to continue.
Ask Claude to create a new tab and try again
Restart the Chrome extension by disabling and re-enabling it in chrome://extensions
(#connection-drops-during-long-sessions) ​
Connection drops during long sessions
The Chrome extension’s service worker can go idle during extended sessions, which breaks the connection. If browser tools stop working after a period of inactivity, run /chrome and select “Reconnect extension”.
(#windows-specific-issues) ​
Windows-specific issues
On Windows, you may encounter:
Named pipe conflicts (EADDRINUSE) : if another process is using the same named pipe, restart Claude Code. Close any other Claude Code sessions that might be using Chrome.
Native messaging host errors : if the native messaging host crashes on startup, try reinstalling Claude Code to regenerate the host configuration.
(#common-error-messages) ​
Common error messages
These are the most frequently encountered errors and how to resolve them:
Error Cause Fix
”Browser extension is not connected” Native messaging host cannot reach the extension Restart Chrome and Claude Code, then run /chrome to reconnect
”Extension not detected” Chrome extension is not installed or is disabled Install or enable the extension in chrome://extensions
”No tab available” Claude tried to act before a tab was ready Ask Claude to create a new tab and retry
”Receiving end does not exist” Extension service worker went idle Run /chrome and select “Reconnect extension”
