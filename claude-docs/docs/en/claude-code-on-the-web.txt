Claude Code on the web is currently in research preview.
(#what-is-claude-code-on-the-web) ​
What is Claude Code on the web?
Claude Code on the web lets developers kick off Claude Code from the Claude app. This is perfect for:
Answering questions : Ask about code architecture and how features are implemented
Bug fixes and routine tasks : Well-defined tasks that don’t require frequent steering
Parallel work : Tackle multiple bug fixes in parallel
Repositories not on your local machine : Work on code you don’t have checked out locally
Backend changes : Where Claude Code can write tests and then write code to pass those tests
Claude Code is also available on the Claude iOS app for kicking off tasks on the go and monitoring work in progress. You can move between local and remote development:  (#from-terminal-to-web) send tasks from your terminal to run on the web with the & prefix, or  (#from-web-to-terminal) teleport web sessions back to your terminal to continue locally.
(#who-can-use-claude-code-on-the-web) ​
Who can use Claude Code on the web?
Claude Code on the web is available in research preview to:
Pro users
Max users
Team users
Enterprise users with premium seats or Chat + Claude Code seats
(#getting-started) ​
Getting started
Visit  (https://claude.ai/code) claude.ai/code
Connect your GitHub account
Install the Claude GitHub app in your repositories
Select your default environment
Submit your coding task
Review changes in diff view, iterate with comments, then create a pull request
(#how-it-works) ​
How it works
When you start a task on Claude Code on the web:
Repository cloning : Your repository is cloned to an Anthropic-managed virtual machine
Environment setup : Claude prepares a secure cloud environment with your code
Network configuration : Internet access is configured based on your settings
Task execution : Claude analyzes code, makes changes, runs tests, and checks its work
Completion : You’re notified when finished and can create a PR with the changes
Results : Changes are pushed to a branch, ready for pull request creation
(#review-changes-with-diff-view) ​
Review changes with diff view
Diff view lets you see exactly what Claude changed before creating a pull request. Instead of clicking “Create PR” to review changes in GitHub, view the diff directly in the app and iterate with Claude until the changes are ready. When Claude makes changes to files, a diff stats indicator appears showing the number of lines added and removed (for example, +12 -1 ). Select this indicator to open the diff viewer, which displays a file list on the left and the changes for each file on the right. From the diff view, you can:
Review changes file by file
Comment on specific changes to request modifications
Continue iterating with Claude based on what you see
This lets you refine changes through multiple rounds of feedback without creating draft PRs or switching to GitHub.
(#moving-tasks-between-web-and-terminal) ​
Moving tasks between web and terminal
You can start tasks on the web and continue them in your terminal, or send tasks from your terminal to run on the web. Web sessions persist even if you close your laptop, and you can monitor them from anywhere including the Claude iOS app.
Session handoff is one-way: you can pull web sessions into your terminal, but you can’t push an existing terminal session to the web. The  (#from-terminal-to-web) & prefix creates a new web session with your current conversation context.
(#from-terminal-to-web) ​
From terminal to web
Start a message with & inside Claude Code to send a task to run on the web:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
& Fix the authentication bug in src/auth/login.ts
This creates a new web session on claude.ai with your current conversation context. The task runs in the cloud while you continue working locally. Use /tasks to check progress, or open the session on claude.ai or the Claude iOS app to interact directly. From there you can steer Claude, provide feedback, or answer questions just like any other conversation. You can also start a web session directly from the command line:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
claude --remote "Fix the authentication bug in src/auth/login.ts"
(#tips-for-background-tasks) ​
Tips for background tasks
Plan locally, execute remotely : For complex tasks, start Claude in plan mode to collaborate on the approach before sending work to the web:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
claude --permission-mode plan
In plan mode, Claude can only read files and explore the codebase. Once you’re satisfied with the plan, send it to the web for autonomous execution:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
& Execute the migration plan we discussed
This pattern gives you control over the strategy while letting Claude execute autonomously in the cloud. Run tasks in parallel : Each & command creates its own web session that runs independently. You can kick off multiple tasks and they’ll all run simultaneously in separate sessions:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
& Fix the flaky test in auth.spec.ts & Update the API documentation & Refactor the logger to use structured output
Monitor all sessions with /tasks . When a session completes, you can create a PR from the web interface or  (#from-web-to-terminal) teleport the session to your terminal to continue working.
(#from-web-to-terminal) ​
From web to terminal
There are several ways to pull a web session into your terminal:
Using /teleport : From within Claude Code, run /teleport (or /tp ) to see an interactive picker of your web sessions. If you have uncommitted changes, you’ll be prompted to stash them first.
Using --teleport : From the command line, run claude --teleport for an interactive session picker, or claude --teleport <session-id> to resume a specific session directly.
From /tasks : Run /tasks to see your background sessions, then press t to teleport into one
From the web interface : Click “Open in CLI” to copy a command you can paste into your terminal
When you teleport a session, Claude verifies you’re in the correct repository, fetches and checks out the branch from the remote session, and loads the full conversation history into your terminal.
(#requirements-for-teleporting) ​
Requirements for teleporting
Teleport checks these requirements before resuming a session. If any requirement isn’t met, you’ll see an error or be prompted to resolve the issue.
Requirement Details
Clean git state Your working directory must have no uncommitted changes. Teleport prompts you to stash changes if needed.
Correct repository You must run --teleport from a checkout of the same repository, not a fork.
Branch available The branch from the web session must have been pushed to the remote. Teleport automatically fetches and checks it out.
Same account You must be authenticated to the same Claude.ai account used in the web session.
(#sharing-sessions) ​
Sharing sessions
To share a session, toggle its visibility according to the account
types below. After that, share the session link as-is. Recipients who open your
shared session will see the latest state of the session upon load, but the
recipient’s page will not update in real time.
(#sharing-from-an-enterprise-or-teams-account) ​
Sharing from an Enterprise or Teams account
For Enterprise and Teams accounts, the two visibility options are Private and Team . Team visibility makes the session visible to other members of your
Claude.ai organization. Repository access verification is enabled by default,
based on the GitHub account connected to the recipient’s account. Your account’s
display name is visible to all recipients with access.  (/docs/en/slack) Claude in Slack sessions are automatically shared with Team visibility.
(#sharing-from-a-max-or-pro-account) ​
Sharing from a Max or Pro account
For Max and Pro accounts, the two visibility options are Private and Public . Public visibility makes the session visible to any user logged
into claude.ai. Check your session for sensitive content before sharing. Sessions may contain
code and credentials from private GitHub repositories. Repository access
verification is not enabled by default. Enable repository access verification and/or withhold your name from your shared
sessions by going to Settings > Claude Code > Sharing settings.
(#cloud-environment) ​
Cloud environment
(#default-image) ​
Default image
We build and maintain a universal image with common toolchains and language ecosystems pre-installed. This image includes:
Popular programming languages and runtimes
Common build tools and package managers
Testing frameworks and linters
(#checking-available-tools) ​
Checking available tools
To see what’s pre-installed in your environment, ask Claude Code to run:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
check-tools
This command displays:
Programming languages and their versions
Available package managers
Installed development tools
(#language-specific-setups) ​
Language-specific setups
The universal image includes pre-configured environments for:
Python : Python 3.x with pip, poetry, and common scientific libraries
Node.js : Latest LTS versions with npm, yarn, pnpm, and bun
Ruby : Versions 3.1.6, 3.2.6, 3.3.6 (default: 3.3.6) with gem, bundler, and rbenv for version management
PHP : Version 8.4.14
Java : OpenJDK with Maven and Gradle
Go : Latest stable version with module support
Rust : Rust toolchain with cargo
C++ : GCC and Clang compilers
(#databases) ​
Databases
The universal image includes the following databases:
PostgreSQL : Version 16
Redis : Version 7.0
(#environment-configuration) ​
Environment configuration
When you start a session in Claude Code on the web, here’s what happens under the hood:
Environment preparation : We clone your repository and run any configured Claude hooks for initialization. The repo will be cloned with the default branch on your GitHub repo. If you would like to check out a specific branch, you can specify that in the prompt.
Network configuration : We configure internet access for the agent. Internet access is limited by default, but you can configure the environment to have no internet or full internet access based on your needs.
Claude Code execution : Claude Code runs to complete your task, writing code, running tests, and checking its work. You can guide and steer Claude throughout the session via the web interface. Claude respects context you’ve defined in your CLAUDE.md .
Outcome : When Claude completes its work, it will push the branch to remote. You will be able to create a PR for the branch.
Claude operates entirely through the terminal and CLI tools available in the environment. It uses the pre-installed tools in the universal image and any additional tools you install through hooks or dependency management.
To add a new environment: Select the current environment to open the environment selector, and then select “Add environment”. This will open a dialog where you can specify the environment name, network access level, and any environment variables you want to set. To update an existing environment: Select the current environment, to the right of the environment name, and select the settings button. This will open a dialog where you can update the environment name, network access, and environment variables. To select your default environment from the terminal: If you have multiple environments configured, run /remote-env to choose which one to use when starting web sessions from your terminal with & or --remote . With a single environment, this command shows your current configuration.
Environment variables must be specified as key-value pairs, in  (https://www.dotenv.org/) .env format . For example:

Copy
Ask AI
API_KEY=your_api_key DEBUG=true
(#dependency-management) ​
Dependency management
Custom environment images and snapshots are not yet supported. As a workaround, you can use  (/docs/en/hooks#sessionstart) SessionStart hooks to install packages when a session starts. This approach has  (#dependency-management-limitations) known limitations . To configure automatic dependency installation, add a SessionStart hook to your repository’s .claude/settings.json file:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
{ "hooks" : { "SessionStart" : [ { "matcher" : "startup" , "hooks" : [ { "type" : "command" , "command" : " \" $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR \" /scripts/install_pkgs.sh" } ] } ] } }
Create the corresponding script at scripts/install_pkgs.sh :
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
#!/bin/bash # Only run in remote environments if [ " $CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE " != "true" ]; then exit 0 fi npm install pip install -r requirements.txt exit 0
Make it executable: chmod +x scripts/install_pkgs.sh
(#persist-environment-variables) ​
Persist environment variables
SessionStart hooks can persist environment variables for subsequent Bash commands by writing to the file specified in the CLAUDE_ENV_FILE environment variable. For details, see  (/docs/en/hooks#sessionstart) SessionStart hooks in the hooks reference.
(#dependency-management-limitations) ​
Dependency management limitations
Hooks fire for all sessions : SessionStart hooks run in both local and remote environments. There is no hook configuration to scope a hook to remote sessions only. To skip local execution, check the CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE environment variable in your script as shown above.
Requires network access : Install commands need network access to reach package registries. If your environment is configured with “No internet” access, these hooks will fail. Use “Limited” (the default) or “Full” network access. The  (#default-allowed-domains) default allowlist includes common registries like npm, PyPI, RubyGems, and crates.io.
Proxy compatibility : All outbound traffic in remote environments passes through a  (#security-proxy) security proxy . Some package managers do not work correctly with this proxy. Bun is a known example.
Runs on every session start : Hooks run each time a session starts or resumes, adding startup latency. Keep install scripts fast by checking whether dependencies are already present before reinstalling.
(#network-access-and-security) ​
Network access and security
(#network-policy) ​
Network policy
(#github-proxy) ​
GitHub proxy
For security, all GitHub operations go through a dedicated proxy service that transparently handles all git interactions. Inside the sandbox, the git client authenticates using a custom-built scoped credential. This proxy:
Manages GitHub authentication securely - the git client uses a scoped credential inside the sandbox, which the proxy verifies and translates to your actual GitHub authentication token
Restricts git push operations to the current working branch for safety
Enables seamless cloning, fetching, and PR operations while maintaining security boundaries
(#security-proxy) ​
Security proxy
Environments run behind an HTTP/HTTPS network proxy for security and abuse prevention purposes. All outbound internet traffic passes through this proxy, which provides:
Protection against malicious requests
Rate limiting and abuse prevention
Content filtering for enhanced security
(#access-levels) ​
Access levels
By default, network access is limited to  (#default-allowed-domains) allowlisted domains . You can configure custom network access, including disabling network access.
(#default-allowed-domains) ​
Default allowed domains
When using “Limited” network access, the following domains are allowed by default:

Security best practices for customized network access
Principle of least privilege : Only enable the minimum network access required
Audit regularly : Review allowed domains periodically
Use HTTPS : Always prefer HTTPS endpoints over HTTP
(#security-and-isolation) ​
Security and isolation
Claude Code on the web provides strong security guarantees:
Isolated virtual machines : Each session runs in an isolated, Anthropic-managed VM
Network access controls : Network access is limited by default, and can be disabled
When running with network access disabled, Claude Code is allowed to communicate with the Anthropic API which may still allow data to exit the isolated Claude Code VM.
Credential protection : Sensitive credentials (such as git credentials or signing keys) are never inside the sandbox with Claude Code. Authentication is handled through a secure proxy using scoped credentials
Secure analysis : Code is analyzed and modified within isolated VMs before creating PRs
(#pricing-and-rate-limits) ​
Pricing and rate limits
Claude Code on the web shares rate limits with all other Claude and Claude Code usage within your account. Running multiple tasks in parallel will consume more rate limits proportionately.
(#limitations) ​
Limitations
Repository authentication : You can only move sessions from web to local when you are authenticated to the same account
Platform restrictions : Claude Code on the web only works with code hosted in GitHub. GitLab and other non-GitHub repositories cannot be used with cloud sessions
(#best-practices) ​
Best practices
Use Claude Code hooks : Configure  (/docs/en/hooks#sessionstart) SessionStart hooks to automate environment setup and dependency installation.
Document requirements : Clearly specify dependencies and commands in your CLAUDE.md file. If you have an AGENTS.md file, you can source it in your CLAUDE.md using @AGENTS.md to maintain a single source of truth.
