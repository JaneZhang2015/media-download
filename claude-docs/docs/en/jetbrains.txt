Claude Code integrates with JetBrains IDEs through a dedicated plugin, providing features like interactive diff viewing, selection context sharing, and more.
(#supported-ides) ​
Supported IDEs
The Claude Code plugin works with most JetBrains IDEs, including:
IntelliJ IDEA
PyCharm
Android Studio
WebStorm
PhpStorm
GoLand
(#features) ​
Features
Quick launch : Use Cmd+Esc (Mac) or Ctrl+Esc (Windows/Linux) to open Claude Code directly from your editor, or click the Claude Code button in the UI
Diff viewing : Code changes can be displayed directly in the IDE diff viewer instead of the terminal
Selection context : The current selection/tab in the IDE is automatically shared with Claude Code
File reference shortcuts : Use Cmd+Option+K (Mac) or Alt+Ctrl+K (Linux/Windows) to insert file references (for example, @File#L1-99)
Diagnostic sharing : Diagnostic errors (lint, syntax, etc.) from the IDE are automatically shared with Claude as you work
(#installation) ​
Installation
(#marketplace-installation) ​
Marketplace Installation
Find and install the  (https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/27310-claude-code-beta-) Claude Code plugin from the JetBrains marketplace and restart your IDE. If you haven’t installed Claude Code yet, see  (/docs/en/quickstart) our quickstart guide for installation instructions.
After installing the plugin, you may need to restart your IDE completely for it to take effect.
(#usage) ​
Usage
(#from-your-ide) ​
From Your IDE
Run claude from your IDE’s integrated terminal, and all integration features will be active.
(#from-external-terminals) ​
From External Terminals
Use the /ide command in any external terminal to connect Claude Code to your JetBrains IDE and activate all features:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
claude > /ide
If you want Claude to have access to the same files as your IDE, start Claude Code from the same directory as your IDE project root.
(#configuration) ​
Configuration
(#claude-code-settings) ​
Claude Code Settings
Configure IDE integration through Claude Code’s settings:
Run claude
Enter the /config command
Set the diff tool to auto for automatic IDE detection
(#plugin-settings) ​
Plugin Settings
Configure the Claude Code plugin by going to Settings → Tools → Claude Code [Beta] :
(#general-settings) ​
General Settings
Claude command : Specify a custom command to run Claude (for example, claude , /usr/local/bin/claude , or npx @anthropic/claude )
Suppress notification for Claude command not found : Skip notifications about not finding the Claude command
Enable using Option+Enter for multi-line prompts (macOS only): When enabled, Option+Enter inserts new lines in Claude Code prompts. Disable if experiencing issues with the Option key being captured unexpectedly (requires terminal restart)
Enable automatic updates : Automatically check for and install plugin updates (applied on restart)
For WSL users: Set wsl -d Ubuntu -- bash -lic "claude" as your Claude command (replace Ubuntu with your WSL distribution name)
(#esc-key-configuration) ​
ESC Key Configuration
If the ESC key doesn’t interrupt Claude Code operations in JetBrains terminals:
Go to Settings → Tools → Terminal
Either:
Uncheck “Move focus to the editor with Escape”, or
Click “Configure terminal keybindings” and delete the “Switch focus to Editor” shortcut
Apply the changes
This allows the ESC key to properly interrupt Claude Code operations.
(#special-configurations) ​
Special Configurations
(#remote-development) ​
Remote Development
When using JetBrains Remote Development, you must install the plugin in the remote host via Settings → Plugin (Host) .
The plugin must be installed on the remote host, not on your local client machine.
(#wsl-configuration) ​
WSL Configuration
WSL users may need additional configuration for IDE detection to work properly. See our  (/docs/en/troubleshooting#jetbrains-ide-not-detected-on-wsl2) WSL troubleshooting guide for detailed setup instructions.
WSL configuration may require:
Proper terminal configuration
Networking mode adjustments
Firewall settings updates
(#troubleshooting) ​
Troubleshooting
(#plugin-not-working) ​
Plugin Not Working
Ensure you’re running Claude Code from the project root directory
Check that the JetBrains plugin is enabled in the IDE settings
Completely restart the IDE (you may need to do this multiple times)
For Remote Development, ensure the plugin is installed in the remote host
(#ide-not-detected) ​
IDE Not Detected
Verify the plugin is installed and enabled
Restart the IDE completely
Check that you’re running Claude Code from the integrated terminal
For WSL users, see the  (/docs/en/troubleshooting#jetbrains-ide-not-detected-on-wsl2) WSL troubleshooting guide
(#command-not-found) ​
Command Not Found
If clicking the Claude icon shows “command not found”:
Verify Claude Code is installed: npm list -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
Configure the Claude command path in plugin settings
For WSL users, use the WSL command format mentioned in the configuration section
(#security-considerations) ​
Security Considerations
When Claude Code runs in a JetBrains IDE with auto-edit permissions enabled, it may be able to modify IDE configuration files that can be automatically executed by your IDE. This may increase the risk of running Claude Code in auto-edit mode and allow bypassing Claude Code’s permission prompts for bash execution. When running in JetBrains IDEs, consider:
Using manual approval mode for edits
Taking extra care to ensure Claude is only used with trusted prompts
Being aware of which files Claude Code has access to modify
For additional help, see our  (/docs/en/troubleshooting) troubleshooting guide .
