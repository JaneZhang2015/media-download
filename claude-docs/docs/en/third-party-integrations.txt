For most organizations, Claude for Teams or Claude for Enterprise provides the best experience. Team members get access to both Claude Code and Claude on the web with a single subscription, centralized billing, and no infrastructure setup required. Claude for Teams is self-service and includes collaboration features, admin tools, and billing management. Best for smaller teams that need to get started quickly. Claude for Enterprise adds SSO and domain capture, role-based permissions, compliance API access, and managed policy settings for deploying organization-wide Claude Code configurations. Best for larger organizations with security and compliance requirements.

(#configure-proxies-and-gateways) ​
Configure proxies and gateways
Most organizations can use a cloud provider directly without additional configuration. However, you may need to configure a corporate proxy or LLM gateway if your organization has specific network or management requirements. These are different configurations that can be used together:
Corporate proxy : Routes traffic through an HTTP/HTTPS proxy. Use this if your organization requires all outbound traffic to pass through a proxy server for security monitoring, compliance, or network policy enforcement. Configure with the HTTPS_PROXY or HTTP_PROXY environment variables. Learn more in  (/docs/en/network-config) Enterprise network configuration .
LLM Gateway : A service that sits between Claude Code and the cloud provider to handle authentication and routing. Use this if you need centralized usage tracking across teams, custom rate limiting or budgets, or centralized authentication management. Configure with the ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL , ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL , or ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL environment variables. Learn more in  (/docs/en/llm-gateway) LLM gateway configuration .
The following examples show the environment variables to set in your shell or shell profile ( .bashrc , .zshrc ). See  (/docs/en/settings) Settings for other configuration methods.

Best practices for organizations
(#invest-in-documentation-and-memory) ​
Invest in documentation and memory
We strongly recommend investing in documentation so that Claude Code understands your codebase. Organizations can deploy CLAUDE.md files at multiple levels:
Organization-wide : Deploy to system directories like /Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/CLAUDE.md (macOS) for company-wide standards
Repository-level : Create CLAUDE.md files in repository roots containing project architecture, build commands, and contribution guidelines. Check these into source control so all users benefit
Learn more in  (/docs/en/memory) Memory and CLAUDE.md files .
(#simplify-deployment) ​
Simplify deployment
If you have a custom development environment, we find that creating a “one click” way to install Claude Code is key to growing adoption across an organization.
(#start-with-guided-usage) ​
Start with guided usage
Encourage new users to try Claude Code for codebase Q&A, or on smaller bug fixes or feature requests. Ask Claude Code to make a plan. Check Claude’s suggestions and give feedback if it’s off-track. Over time, as users understand this new paradigm better, then they’ll be more effective at letting Claude Code run more agentically.
(#pin-model-versions-for-cloud-providers) ​
Pin model versions for cloud providers
If you deploy through  (/docs/en/amazon-bedrock) Bedrock ,  (/docs/en/google-vertex-ai) Vertex AI , or  (/docs/en/microsoft-foundry) Foundry , pin specific model versions using ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL , ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL , and ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL . Without pinning, Claude Code aliases resolve to the latest version, which can break users when Anthropic releases a new model that isn’t yet enabled in your account. See  (/docs/en/model-config#pin-models-for-third-party-deployments) Model configuration for details.
(#configure-security-policies) ​
Configure security policies
Security teams can configure managed permissions for what Claude Code is and is not allowed to do, which cannot be overwritten by local configuration.  (/docs/en/security) Learn more .
(#leverage-mcp-for-integrations) ​
Leverage MCP for integrations
MCP is a great way to give Claude Code more information, such as connecting to ticket management systems or error logs. We recommend that one central team configures MCP servers and checks a .mcp.json configuration into the codebase so that all users benefit.  (/docs/en/mcp) Learn more . At Anthropic, we trust Claude Code to power development across every Anthropic codebase. We hope you enjoy using Claude Code as much as we do.
(#next-steps) ​
Next steps
Once you’ve chosen a deployment option and configured access for your team:
Roll out to your team : Share installation instructions and have team members  (/docs/en/setup) install Claude Code and authenticate with their credentials.
Set up shared configuration : Create a  (/docs/en/memory) CLAUDE.md file in your repositories to help Claude Code understand your codebase and coding standards.
Configure permissions : Review  (/docs/en/security) security settings to define what Claude Code can and cannot do in your environment.
