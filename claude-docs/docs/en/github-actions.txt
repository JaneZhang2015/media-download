Copy page
Claude Code GitHub Actions brings AI-powered automation to your GitHub workflow. With a simple @claude mention in any PR or issue, Claude can analyze your code, create pull requests, implement features, and fix bugs - all while following your project’s standards.
Claude Code GitHub Actions is built on top of the  (https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) Claude
Agent SDK , which enables programmatic integration of
Claude Code into your applications. You can use the SDK to build custom
automation workflows beyond GitHub Actions.
Claude Opus 4.6 is now available. Claude Code GitHub Actions default to Sonnet. To use Opus 4.6, configure the  (#breaking-changes-reference) model parameter to use claude-opus-4-6 .
(#why-use-claude-code-github-actions) ​
Why use Claude Code GitHub Actions?
Instant PR creation : Describe what you need, and Claude creates a complete PR with all necessary changes
Automated code implementation : Turn issues into working code with a single command
Follows your standards : Claude respects your CLAUDE.md guidelines and existing code patterns
Simple setup : Get started in minutes with our installer and API key
Secure by default : Your code stays on Github’s runners
(#what-can-claude-do) ​
What can Claude do?
Claude Code provides a powerful GitHub Action that transforms how you work with code:
(#claude-code-action) ​
Claude Code Action
This GitHub Action allows you to run Claude Code within your GitHub Actions workflows. You can use this to build any custom workflow on top of Claude Code.  (https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action) View repository →
(#setup) ​
Setup
(#quick-setup) ​
Quick setup
The easiest way to set up this action is through Claude Code in the terminal. Just open claude and run /install-github-app . This command will guide you through setting up the GitHub app and required secrets.
You must be a repository admin to install the GitHub app and add secrets
The GitHub app will request read & write permissions for Contents, Issues, and Pull requests
This quickstart method is only available for direct Claude API users. If
you’re using AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI, please see the  (#using-with-aws-bedrock-%26-google-vertex-ai) Using with AWS
Bedrock & Google Vertex AI section.
(#manual-setup) ​
Manual setup
If the /install-github-app command fails or you prefer manual setup, please follow these manual setup instructions:
Install the Claude GitHub app to your repository:  (https://github.com/apps/claude) https://github.com/apps/claude The Claude GitHub app requires the following repository permissions:
Contents : Read & write (to modify repository files)
Issues : Read & write (to respond to issues)
Pull requests : Read & write (to create PRs and push changes)
For more details on security and permissions, see the  (https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/docs/security.md) security documentation .
Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to your repository secrets (  (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) Learn how to use secrets in GitHub Actions )
Copy the workflow file from  (https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/examples/claude.yml) examples/claude.yml into your repository’s .github/workflows/
After completing either the quickstart or manual setup, test the action by tagging @claude in an issue or PR comment.
(#upgrading-from-beta) ​
Upgrading from Beta
Claude Code GitHub Actions v1.0 introduces breaking changes that require updating your workflow files in order to upgrade to v1.0 from the beta version.
If you’re currently using the beta version of Claude Code GitHub Actions, we recommend that you update your workflows to use the GA version. The new version simplifies configuration while adding powerful new features like automatic mode detection.
(#essential-changes) ​
Essential changes
All beta users must make these changes to their workflow files in order to upgrade:
Update the action version : Change @beta to @v1
Remove mode configuration : Delete mode: "tag" or mode: "agent" (now auto-detected)
Update prompt inputs : Replace direct_prompt with prompt
Move CLI options : Convert max_turns , model , custom_instructions , etc. to claude_args
(#breaking-changes-reference) ​
Breaking Changes Reference
Old Beta Input New v1.0 Input
mode (Removed - auto-detected)
direct_prompt prompt
override_prompt prompt with GitHub variables
custom_instructions claude_args: --append-system-prompt
max_turns claude_args: --max-turns
model claude_args: --model
allowed_tools claude_args: --allowedTools

Best practices
(#claude-md-configuration) ​
CLAUDE.md configuration
Create a CLAUDE.md file in your repository root to define code style guidelines, review criteria, project-specific rules, and preferred patterns. This file guides Claude’s understanding of your project standards.
(#security-considerations) ​
Security considerations
Never commit API keys directly to your repository.
For comprehensive security guidance including permissions, authentication, and best practices, see the  (https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/docs/security.md) Claude Code Action security documentation . Always use GitHub Secrets for API keys:
Add your API key as a repository secret named ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
Reference it in workflows: anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
Limit action permissions to only what’s necessary
Review Claude’s suggestions before merging
Always use GitHub Secrets (for example, ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }} ) rather than hardcoding API keys directly in your workflow files.
(#optimizing-performance) ​
Optimizing performance
Use issue templates to provide context, keep your CLAUDE.md concise and focused, and configure appropriate timeouts for your workflows.
(#ci-costs) ​
CI costs
When using Claude Code GitHub Actions, be aware of the associated costs: GitHub Actions costs:
Claude Code runs on GitHub-hosted runners, which consume your GitHub Actions minutes
See  (https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions) GitHub’s billing documentation for detailed pricing and minute limits
API costs:
Each Claude interaction consumes API tokens based on the length of prompts and responses
Token usage varies by task complexity and codebase size
See  (https://claude.com/platform/api) Claude’s pricing page for current token rates
Cost optimization tips:
Use specific @claude commands to reduce unnecessary API calls
Configure appropriate --max-turns in claude_args to prevent excessive iterations
Set workflow-level timeouts to avoid runaway jobs
Consider using GitHub’s concurrency controls to limit parallel runs
(#configuration-examples) ​
Configuration examples

Flexible triggers - Works with any GitHub event
Visit the  (https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/tree/main/examples) examples directory for complete workflow files.
When responding to issue or PR comments, Claude automatically responds to @claude mentions. For other events, use the prompt parameter to provide instructions.
(#using-with-aws-bedrock-&-google-vertex-ai) ​
Using with AWS Bedrock & Google Vertex AI
For enterprise environments, you can use Claude Code GitHub Actions with your own cloud infrastructure. This approach gives you control over data residency and billing while maintaining the same functionality.
(#prerequisites) ​
Prerequisites
Before setting up Claude Code GitHub Actions with cloud providers, you need:
(#for-google-cloud-vertex-ai) ​
For Google Cloud Vertex AI:
A Google Cloud Project with Vertex AI enabled
Workload Identity Federation configured for GitHub Actions
A service account with the required permissions
A GitHub App (recommended) or use the default GITHUB_TOKEN
(#for-aws-bedrock) ​
For AWS Bedrock:
An AWS account with Amazon Bedrock enabled
GitHub OIDC Identity Provider configured in AWS
An IAM role with Bedrock permissions
A GitHub App (recommended) or use the default GITHUB_TOKEN
1
(#)
Create a custom GitHub App (Recommended for 3P Providers)
For best control and security when using 3P providers like Vertex AI or Bedrock, we recommend creating your own GitHub App:
Go to  (https://github.com/settings/apps/new) https://github.com/settings/apps/new
Fill in the basic information:
GitHub App name : Choose a unique name (e.g., “YourOrg Claude Assistant”)
Homepage URL : Your organization’s website or the repository URL
Configure the app settings:
Webhooks : Uncheck “Active” (not needed for this integration)
Set the required permissions:
Repository permissions :
Contents: Read & Write
Issues: Read & Write
Pull requests: Read & Write
Click “Create GitHub App”
After creation, click “Generate a private key” and save the downloaded .pem file
Note your App ID from the app settings page
Install the app to your repository:
From your app’s settings page, click “Install App” in the left sidebar
Select your account or organization
Choose “Only select repositories” and select the specific repository
Click “Install”
Add the private key as a secret to your repository:
Go to your repository’s Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
Create a new secret named APP_PRIVATE_KEY with the contents of the .pem file
Add the App ID as a secret:
Create a new secret named APP_ID with your GitHub App’s ID
This app will be used with the  (https://github.com/actions/create-github-app-token) actions/create-github-app-token action to generate authentication tokens in your workflows.
Alternative for Claude API or if you don’t want to setup your own Github app : Use the official Anthropic app:
Install from:  (https://github.com/apps/claude) https://github.com/apps/claude
No additional configuration needed for authentication
2
(#)
Configure cloud provider authentication
Choose your cloud provider and set up secure authentication:
AWS Bedrock
Configure AWS to allow GitHub Actions to authenticate securely without storing credentials.
Security Note : Use repository-specific configurations and grant only the minimum required permissions.
Required Setup :
Enable Amazon Bedrock :
Request access to Claude models in Amazon Bedrock
For cross-region models, request access in all required regions
Set up GitHub OIDC Identity Provider :
Provider URL: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
Audience: sts.amazonaws.com
Create IAM Role for GitHub Actions :
Trusted entity type: Web identity
Identity provider: token.actions.githubusercontent.com
Permissions: AmazonBedrockFullAccess policy
Configure trust policy for your specific repository
Required Values : After setup, you’ll need:
AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME : The ARN of the IAM role you created
OIDC is more secure than using static AWS access keys because credentials are temporary and automatically rotated.
See  (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html) AWS documentation for detailed OIDC setup instructions.
Google Vertex AI
Configure Google Cloud to allow GitHub Actions to authenticate securely without storing credentials.
Security Note : Use repository-specific configurations and grant only the minimum required permissions.
Required Setup :
Enable APIs in your Google Cloud project:
IAM Credentials API
Security Token Service (STS) API
Vertex AI API
Create Workload Identity Federation resources :
Create a Workload Identity Pool
Add a GitHub OIDC provider with:
Issuer: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
Attribute mappings for repository and owner
Security recommendation : Use repository-specific attribute conditions
Create a Service Account :
Grant only Vertex AI User role
Security recommendation : Create a dedicated service account per repository
Configure IAM bindings :
Allow the Workload Identity Pool to impersonate the service account
Security recommendation : Use repository-specific principal sets
Required Values : After setup, you’ll need:
GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER : The full provider resource name
GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT : The service account email address
Workload Identity Federation eliminates the need for downloadable service account keys, improving security.
For detailed setup instructions, consult the  (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation) Google Cloud Workload Identity Federation documentation .

(#claude-not-responding-to-@claude-commands) ​
Claude not responding to @claude commands
Verify the GitHub App is installed correctly, check that workflows are enabled, ensure API key is set in repository secrets, and confirm the comment contains @claude (not /claude ).
(#ci-not-running-on-claude’s-commits) ​
CI not running on Claude’s commits
Ensure you’re using the GitHub App or custom app (not Actions user), check workflow triggers include the necessary events, and verify app permissions include CI triggers.
(#authentication-errors) ​
Authentication errors
Confirm API key is valid and has sufficient permissions. For Bedrock/Vertex, check credentials configuration and ensure secrets are named correctly in workflows.
(#advanced-configuration) ​
Advanced configuration
(#action-parameters) ​
Action parameters

Parameter Description Required
prompt Instructions for Claude (text or skill like /review ) No*
claude_args CLI arguments passed to Claude Code No
anthropic_api_key Claude API key Yes**
github_token GitHub token for API access No
trigger_phrase Custom trigger phrase (default: “@claude”) No
use_bedrock Use AWS Bedrock instead of Claude API No
use_vertex Use Google Vertex AI instead of Claude API No
*Prompt is optional - when omitted for issue/PR comments, Claude responds to trigger phrase
**Required for direct Claude API, not for Bedrock/Vertex
(#pass-cli-arguments) ​
Pass CLI arguments

Copy
Ask AI
claude_args : "--max-turns 5 --model claude-sonnet-4-6 --mcp-config /path/to/config.json"
Common arguments:
--max-turns : Maximum conversation turns (default: 10)
--model : Model to use (for example, claude-sonnet-4-6 )
--mcp-config : Path to MCP configuration
--allowed-tools : Comma-separated list of allowed tools
--debug : Enable debug output
(#alternative-integration-methods) ​
Alternative integration methods
While the /install-github-app command is the recommended approach, you can also:
Custom GitHub App : For organizations needing branded usernames or custom authentication flows. Create your own GitHub App with required permissions (contents, issues, pull requests) and use the actions/create-github-app-token action to generate tokens in your workflows.
Manual GitHub Actions : Direct workflow configuration for maximum flexibility
MCP Configuration : Dynamic loading of Model Context Protocol servers
See the  (https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/docs) Claude Code Action documentation for detailed guides on authentication, security, and advanced configuration.
(#customizing-claude’s-behavior) ​
Customizing Claude’s behavior
You can configure Claude’s behavior in two ways:
CLAUDE.md : Define coding standards, review criteria, and project-specific rules in a CLAUDE.md file at the root of your repository. Claude will follow these guidelines when creating PRs and responding to requests. Check out our  (/docs/en/memory) Memory documentation for more details.
Custom prompts : Use the prompt parameter in the workflow file to provide workflow-specific instructions. This allows you to customize Claude’s behavior for different workflows or tasks.
Claude will follow these guidelines when creating PRs and responding to requests.
