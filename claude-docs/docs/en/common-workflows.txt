Check the  (/docs/en/sub-agents) subagents documentation for detailed examples
(#use-plan-mode-for-safe-code-analysis) ​
Use Plan Mode for safe code analysis
Plan Mode instructs Claude to create a plan by analyzing the codebase with read-only operations, perfect for exploring codebases, planning complex changes, or reviewing code safely. In Plan Mode, Claude uses  (/docs/en/settings#tools-available-to-claude) AskUserQuestion to gather requirements and clarify your goals before proposing a plan.
(#when-to-use-plan-mode) ​
When to use Plan Mode
Multi-step implementation : When your feature requires making edits to many files
Code exploration : When you want to research the codebase thoroughly before changing anything
Interactive development : When you want to iterate on the direction with Claude
(#how-to-use-plan-mode) ​
How to use Plan Mode
Turn on Plan Mode during a session You can switch into Plan Mode during a session using Shift+Tab to cycle through permission modes. If you are in Normal Mode, Shift+Tab first switches into Auto-Accept Mode, indicated by ⏵⏵ accept edits on at the bottom of the terminal. A subsequent Shift+Tab will switch into Plan Mode, indicated by ⏸ plan mode on . Start a new session in Plan Mode To start a new session in Plan Mode, use the --permission-mode plan flag:

Claude can generate tests that follow your project’s existing patterns and conventions. When asking for tests, be specific about what behavior you want to verify. Claude examines your existing test files to match the style, frameworks, and assertion patterns already in use. For comprehensive coverage, ask Claude to identify edge cases you might have missed. Claude can analyze your code paths and suggest tests for error conditions, boundary values, and unexpected inputs that are easy to overlook.
(#create-pull-requests) ​
Create pull requests
You can create pull requests by asking Claude directly (“create a pr for my changes”) or by using the /commit-push-pr skill, which commits, pushes, and opens a PR in one step.
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
> /commit-push-pr
If you have a Slack MCP server configured and specify channels in your CLAUDE.md (for example, “post PR URLs to #team-prs”), the skill automatically posts the PR URL to those channels. For more control over the process, guide Claude through it step-by-step or  (/docs/en/skills) create your own skill :

This provides a directory listing with file information.
3
(#)
Reference MCP resources

Copy
Ask AI
> Show me the data from @github:repos/owner/repo/issues
This fetches data from connected MCP servers using the format @server:resource. See  (/docs/en/mcp#use-mcp-resources) MCP resources for details.
Tips:
File paths can be relative or absolute
@ file references add CLAUDE.md in the file’s directory and parent directories to context
Directory references show file listings, not contents
You can reference multiple files in a single message (for example, “@file1.js and @file2.js”)
(#use-extended-thinking-thinking-mode) ​
Use extended thinking (thinking mode)
(https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) Extended thinking is enabled by default, giving Claude space to reason through complex problems step-by-step before responding. This reasoning is visible in verbose mode, which you can toggle on with Ctrl+O . Additionally, Opus 4.6 introduces adaptive reasoning: instead of a fixed thinking token budget, the model dynamically allocates thinking based on your  (/docs/en/model-config#adjust-effort-level) effort level setting. Extended thinking and adaptive reasoning work together to give you control over how deeply Claude reasons before responding. Extended thinking is particularly valuable for complex architectural decisions, challenging bugs, multi-step implementation planning, and evaluating tradeoffs between different approaches.
Phrases like “think”, “think hard”, “ultrathink”, and “think more” are interpreted as regular prompt instructions and don’t allocate thinking tokens.
(#configure-thinking-mode) ​
Configure thinking mode
Thinking is enabled by default, but you can adjust or disable it.
Scope How to configure Details
Effort level Adjust in /model or set  (/docs/en/settings#environment-variables) CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL Control thinking depth for Opus 4.6: low, medium, high (default). See  (/docs/en/model-config#adjust-effort-level) Adjust effort level
Toggle shortcut Press Option+T (macOS) or Alt+T (Windows/Linux) Toggle thinking on/off for the current session (all models). May require  (/docs/en/terminal-config) terminal configuration to enable Option key shortcuts
Global default Use /config to toggle thinking mode Sets your default across all projects (all models).
Saved as alwaysThinkingEnabled in ~/.claude/settings.json
Limit token budget Set  (/docs/en/settings#environment-variables) MAX_THINKING_TOKENS environment variable Limit the thinking budget to a specific number of tokens (ignored on Opus 4.6 unless set to 0). Example: export MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=10000
To view Claude’s thinking process, press Ctrl+O to toggle verbose mode and see the internal reasoning displayed as gray italic text.
(#how-extended-thinking-works) ​
How extended thinking works
Extended thinking controls how much internal reasoning Claude performs before responding. More thinking provides more space to explore solutions, analyze edge cases, and self-correct mistakes. With Opus 4.6 , thinking uses adaptive reasoning: the model dynamically allocates thinking tokens based on the  (/docs/en/model-config#adjust-effort-level) effort level you select (low, medium, high). This is the recommended way to tune the tradeoff between speed and reasoning depth. With other models , thinking uses a fixed budget of up to 31,999 tokens from your output budget. You can limit this with the  (/docs/en/settings#environment-variables) MAX_THINKING_TOKENS environment variable, or disable thinking entirely via /config or the Option+T / Alt+T toggle. MAX_THINKING_TOKENS is ignored when using Opus 4.6, since adaptive reasoning controls thinking depth instead. The one exception: setting MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=0 still disables thinking entirely on any model.
You’re charged for all thinking tokens used, even though Claude 4 models show summarized thinking
(#resume-previous-conversations) ​
Resume previous conversations
When starting Claude Code, you can resume a previous session:
claude --continue continues the most recent conversation in the current directory
claude --resume opens a conversation picker or resumes by name
claude --from-pr 123 resumes sessions linked to a specific pull request
From inside an active session, use /resume to switch to a different conversation. Sessions are stored per project directory. The /resume picker shows sessions from the same git repository, including worktrees.
(#name-your-sessions) ​
Name your sessions
Give sessions descriptive names to find them later. This is a best practice when working on multiple tasks or features.
1
(#)
Name the current session
Use /rename during a session to give it a memorable name:

From the command line:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
claude --resume auth-refactor
Or from inside an active session:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
> /resume auth-refactor
(#use-the-session-picker) ​
Use the session picker
The /resume command (or claude --resume without arguments) opens an interactive session picker with these features: Keyboard shortcuts in the picker:
Shortcut Action
↑ / ↓ Navigate between sessions
→ / ← Expand or collapse grouped sessions
Enter Select and resume the highlighted session
P Preview the session content
R Rename the highlighted session
/ Search to filter sessions
A Toggle between current directory and all projects
B Filter to sessions from your current git branch
Esc Exit the picker or search mode
Session organization: The picker displays sessions with helpful metadata:
Session name or initial prompt
Time elapsed since last activity
Message count
Git branch (if applicable)
Forked sessions (created with /rewind or --fork-session ) are grouped together under their root session, making it easier to find related conversations.
Tips:
Name sessions early : Use /rename when starting work on a distinct task—it’s much easier to find “payment-integration” than “explain this function” later
Use --continue for quick access to your most recent conversation in the current directory
Use --resume session-name when you know which session you need
Use --resume (without a name) when you need to browse and select
For scripts, use claude --continue --print "prompt" to resume in non-interactive mode
Press P in the picker to preview a session before resuming it
The resumed conversation starts with the same model and configuration as the original
How it works:
Conversation Storage : All conversations are automatically saved locally with their full message history
Message Deserialization : When resuming, the entire message history is restored to maintain context
Tool State : Tool usage and results from the previous conversation are preserved
Context Restoration : The conversation resumes with all previous context intact
(#run-parallel-claude-code-sessions-with-git-worktrees) ​
Run parallel Claude Code sessions with Git worktrees
When working on multiple tasks at once, you need each Claude session to have its own copy of the codebase so changes don’t collide. Git worktrees solve this by creating separate working directories that each have their own files and branch, while sharing the same repository history and remote connections. This means you can have Claude working on a feature in one worktree while fixing a bug in another, without either session interfering with the other. Use the --worktree ( -w ) flag to create an isolated worktree and start Claude in it. The value you pass becomes the worktree directory name and branch name:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
# Start Claude in a worktree named "feature-auth" # Creates .claude/worktrees/feature-auth/ with a new branch claude --worktree feature-auth # Start another session in a separate worktree claude --worktree bugfix-123
If you omit the name, Claude generates a random one automatically:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
# Auto-generates a name like "bright-running-fox" claude --worktree
Worktrees are created at <repo>/.claude/worktrees/<name> and branch from the default remote branch. The worktree branch is named worktree-<name> . You can also ask Claude to “work in a worktree” or “start a worktree” during a session, and it will create one automatically.
(#subagent-worktrees) ​
Subagent worktrees
Subagents can also use worktree isolation to work in parallel without conflicts. Ask Claude to “use worktrees for your agents” or configure it in a  (/docs/en/sub-agents#supported-frontmatter-fields) custom subagent by adding isolation: worktree to the agent’s frontmatter. Each subagent gets its own worktree that is automatically cleaned up when the subagent finishes without changes.
(#worktree-cleanup) ​
Worktree cleanup
When you exit a worktree session, Claude handles cleanup based on whether you made changes:
No changes : the worktree and its branch are removed automatically
Changes or commits exist : Claude prompts you to keep or remove the worktree. Keeping preserves the directory and branch so you can return later. Removing deletes the worktree directory and its branch, discarding all uncommitted changes and commits
To clean up worktrees outside of a Claude session, use  (#manage-worktrees-manually) manual worktree management .
Add .claude/worktrees/ to your .gitignore to prevent worktree contents from appearing as untracked files in your main repository.
(#manage-worktrees-manually) ​
Manage worktrees manually
For more control over worktree location and branch configuration, create worktrees with Git directly. This is useful when you need to check out a specific existing branch or place the worktree outside the repository.

Learn more in the  (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) official Git worktree documentation .
Remember to initialize your development environment in each new worktree according to your project’s setup. Depending on your stack, this might include running dependency installation ( npm install , yarn ), setting up virtual environments, or following your project’s standard setup process.
(#non-git-version-control) ​
Non-git version control
Worktree isolation works with git by default. For other version control systems like SVN, Perforce, or Mercurial, configure  (/docs/en/hooks#worktreecreate) WorktreeCreate and WorktreeRemove hooks to provide custom worktree creation and cleanup logic. When configured, these hooks replace the default git behavior when you use --worktree . For automated coordination of parallel sessions with shared tasks and messaging, see  (/docs/en/agent-teams) agent teams .
(#get-notified-when-claude-needs-your-attention) ​
Get notified when Claude needs your attention
When you kick off a long-running task and switch to another window, you can set up desktop notifications so you know when Claude finishes or needs your input. This uses the Notification  (/docs/en/hooks-guide#get-notified-when-claude-needs-input) hook event , which fires whenever Claude is waiting for permission, idle and ready for a new prompt, or completing authentication.
