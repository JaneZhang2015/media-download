Quickstart
Copy page
Welcome to Claude Code!
Copy page
This quickstart guide will have you using AI-powered coding assistance in just a few minutes. By the end, you’ll understand how to use Claude Code for common development tasks.
(#before-you-begin) ​
Before you begin
Make sure you have:
A terminal or command prompt open
A code project to work with
A  (https://claude.com/pricing) Claude subscription (Pro, Max, Teams, or Enterprise),  (https://console.anthropic.com/) Claude Console account, or access through a  (/docs/en/third-party-integrations) supported cloud provider
This guide covers the terminal CLI. Claude Code is also available on the  (https://claude.ai/code) web , as a  (/docs/en/desktop) desktop app , in  (/docs/en/vs-code) VS Code and  (/docs/en/jetbrains) JetBrains IDEs , in  (/docs/en/slack) Slack , and in CI/CD with  (/docs/en/github-actions) GitHub Actions and  (/docs/en/gitlab-ci-cd) GitLab . See  (/docs/en/overview#use-claude-code-everywhere) all interfaces .
(#step-1-install-claude-code) ​
Step 1: Install Claude Code
To install Claude Code, use one of the following methods:
Native Install (Recommended)
Homebrew
WinGet
macOS, Linux, WSL:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
Windows PowerShell:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
irm https: // claude.ai / install.ps1 | iex
Windows CMD:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
Native installations automatically update in the background to keep you on the latest version.
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
brew install --cask claude-code
Homebrew installations do not auto-update. Run brew upgrade claude-code periodically to get the latest features and security fixes.
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
winget install Anthropic.ClaudeCode
WinGet installations do not auto-update. Run winget upgrade Anthropic.ClaudeCode periodically to get the latest features and security fixes.
(#step-2-log-in-to-your-account) ​
Step 2: Log in to your account
Claude Code requires an account to use. When you start an interactive session with the claude command, you’ll need to log in:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
claude # You'll be prompted to log in on first use
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
/login # Follow the prompts to log in with your account
You can log in using any of these account types:
(https://claude.com/pricing) Claude Pro, Max, Teams, or Enterprise (recommended)
(https://console.anthropic.com/) Claude Console (API access with pre-paid credits). On first login, a “Claude Code” workspace is automatically created in the Console for centralized cost tracking.
(/docs/en/third-party-integrations) Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry (enterprise cloud providers)
Once logged in, your credentials are stored and you won’t need to log in again. To switch accounts later, use the /login command.
(#step-3-start-your-first-session) ​
Step 3: Start your first session
Open your terminal in any project directory and start Claude Code:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
cd /path/to/your/project claude
You’ll see the Claude Code welcome screen with your session information, recent conversations, and latest updates. Type /help for available commands or /resume to continue a previous conversation.
After logging in (Step 2), your credentials are stored on your system. Learn more in  (/docs/en/authentication#credential-management) Credential Management .
(#step-4-ask-your-first-question) ​
Step 4: Ask your first question
Let’s start with understanding your codebase. Try one of these commands:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
what does this project do?
Claude will analyze your files and provide a summary. You can also ask more specific questions:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
what technologies does this project use?
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
where is the main entry point?
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
explain the folder structure
You can also ask Claude about its own capabilities:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
what can Claude Code do?
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
how do I create custom skills in Claude Code?
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
can Claude Code work with Docker?
Claude Code reads your files as needed - you don’t have to manually add context. Claude also has access to its own documentation and can answer questions about its features and capabilities.
(#step-5-make-your-first-code-change) ​
Step 5: Make your first code change
Now let’s make Claude Code do some actual coding. Try a simple task:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
add a hello world function to the main file
Claude Code will:
Find the appropriate file
Show you the proposed changes
Ask for your approval
Make the edit
Claude Code always asks for permission before modifying files. You can approve individual changes or enable “Accept all” mode for a session.
(#step-6-use-git-with-claude-code) ​
Step 6: Use Git with Claude Code
Claude Code makes Git operations conversational:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
what files have I changed?
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
commit my changes with a descriptive message
You can also prompt for more complex Git operations:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
create a new branch called feature/quickstart
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
show me the last 5 commits
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
help me resolve merge conflicts
(#step-7-fix-a-bug-or-add-a-feature) ​
Step 7: Fix a bug or add a feature
Claude is proficient at debugging and feature implementation. Describe what you want in natural language:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
add input validation to the user registration form
Or fix existing issues:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
there's a bug where users can submit empty forms - fix it
Claude Code will:
Locate the relevant code
Understand the context
Implement a solution
Run tests if available
(#step-8-test-out-other-common-workflows) ​
Step 8: Test out other common workflows
There are a number of ways to work with Claude: Refactor code
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
refactor the authentication module to use async/await instead of callbacks
Write tests
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
write unit tests for the calculator functions
Update documentation
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
update the README with installation instructions
Code review
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
review my changes and suggest improvements
Remember : Claude Code is your AI pair programmer. Talk to it like you would a helpful colleague - describe what you want to achieve, and it will help you get there.
(#essential-commands) ​

Pro tips for beginners
For more, see  (/docs/en/best-practices) best practices and  (/docs/en/common-workflows) common workflows .
Be specific with your requests
Instead of: “fix the bug” Try: “fix the login bug where users see a blank screen after entering wrong credentials”
Use step-by-step instructions
Break complex tasks into steps:
Report incorrect code
Copy
Ask AI
1. create a new database table for user profiles 2. create an API endpoint to get and update user profiles 3. build a webpage that allows users to see and edit their information
